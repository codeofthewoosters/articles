      <H1>Implementing a simple Ray Tracer</H1>
      <P>Ray tracing is a simple but powerful approach to photorealistic 
      rendering and implementing a ray tracer is an excellent way to learn a 
      programming language and, in particular, to learn about graphics and 
      optimization in the context of numerical algorithms. This article walks 
      through the design and implementation of a basic ray tracer that ray 
      traces a scene in a Windows Forms application that provides the user with 
      rendering options via a menu and real-time incremental update.</P>
      <H2>Introduction to Ray Tracing</H2>
      <P>Ray tracing is a technique for image synthesis: creating a 2D picture 
      of a 3D world. In the real world, lights emit photons that are reflected 
      off surfaces and refracted through surfaces before reaching a viewer. 
      Although this direct approach can be simulated on computer using a 
      technique called "forward ray tracing", this is very ineffecient because 
      only a tiny proportion of the photons reach the camera. Conventional ray 
      tracing uses "backward ray tracing" instead. The involves tracing rays out 
      from the camera and into the 3D world. For a pixellated display, an 
      individual ray might be shot through each pixel in a pin-hole camera 
      model. Each ray is then intersected with the scene and the closest 
      intersection point incurs further computation. In the simplest case, the 
      color of the object in the 3D world that the ray hit might be used to 
      color the pixel that the ray went through.</P>
      <P>The beauty of ray tracing is the ease with which this simple model can 
      be extended to account for a wide variety of real effects. This example 
      program adds four of the most basic effects:</P>
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI><B>Diffuse reflection</B> models photons from a light source that 
        scatter when they strike a matt surface. The intensity is a function of 
        the angle of incidence and is unrelated to view position.               
        </LI>
        <LI><B>Specular reflection</B> models photons from a light source that 
        are reflected from a shiny surface into the camera. The intensity is a 
        function of the view position.               </LI>
        <LI><B>Shadows</B> are modelled most simply by tracing a shadow ray from 
        a point of intersection toward each light source. If a shadow ray 
        intersects any object in the scene before it reaches the light source 
        then the point of intersection is in shadow and the diffuse and specular 
        contributions are neglected.               </LI>
        <LI><B>Reflections</B> are modelled by tracing the reflection of the 
        incident ray from each point of intersection and adding the reflected 
        constribution to the others for that intersection point. Reflections of 
        reflections and so forth are easily handled by making this process 
        recursive, truncating the contribution when its weight in the overall 
        lighting equation is insignificant.               </LI></OL>
      <P></P>
      <P>For more information about ray tracing, we highly recommend the 
      excellent book:</P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>"An Introduction to Ray Tracing" by Andrew S. Glassner               
           <I>et al.</I>               </LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>The remainder of this article describes the design and implementation 
      of a simple ray tracer with real-time GUI visualization implemented 
      entirely in the F# programming language.</P>
      <H2>Implementation</H2>
      <P>This ray tracer is sufficiently simple that it can be encapsulated in a 
      single compilation unit. The whole program may be coarsely decomposed into 
      the numerical ray tracing algorithm and its associated definitions (such 
      as rays, solids and scenes) and the GUI front-end of the ray tracer than 
      renders incrementally into a Windows Forms Bitmap that can be blitted into 
      the window efficiently.</P>
      <P>The entire program will be written in the #light syntax option:</P>
<PRE>#light</PRE>
      <P>The rendering options are used by both the ray tracing back-end and the 
      visualization front-end, so they appear first in their own              
      <CODE>Options</CODE> module:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; module Options =
    let specular, shadows, reflect = ref false, ref false, ref false;;
module Options : begin
  val reflect : bool ref
  val shadows : bool ref
  val specular : bool ref
end</PRE>
      <P>The ray tracing portion of the program uses colors from the             
       <CODE>System.Drawing</CODE> namespace and vectors of floats from the      
              <CODE>Math.Vector</CODE> namespace:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; open System.Drawing;;
&gt; open Math.Vector;;</PRE>
      <P>The code makes use of two auxiliary mathematical definitions. The value 
      delta quantifies a small number in floating point arithmetic and the sqr 
      function squares the given float value:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let delta = sqrt epsilon_float;;
val delta : float
&gt; let sqr (x : float) = x * x;;
val sqr : float -&gt; float  </PRE>
      <P>The vectors implemented by the F# standard library have arbitrary 
      dimensionality. This ray tracer uses only 3D vectors so we shall supercede 
      the              <CODE>zero</CODE> function defined in the stdlib with the 
      value of the zero 3D vector:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let zero = zero 3;;
val zero : Math.vector</PRE>
      <P>The following              <CODE>normalize</CODE> function scales a 
      vector to have unit length:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let normalize r = 1. / norm r $* r;;
val normalize : Math.vector -&gt; Math.vector</PRE>
      <P>A ray is quantified by its origin and direction vectors:</P>
<PRE>&gt; type ray = { orig: vector; dir: vector };;
type ray = {orig: vector;
            dir: vector;}</PRE>
      <P>Intersection points will be quantified in terms of a ray as the 
      parametric position along the ray.</P>
      <P>This ray tracer will support two solid geometries: spheres and planes. 
      The record types implementing these two geometries are most productively 
      separated into separate modules              <CODE>Sphere</CODE> and       
             <CODE>Plane</CODE> to avoid clashing field names:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; module Sphere =
    type t = { center: vector; radius: float };;
module Sphere : begin
  type t = {center: vector;
            radius: float;}
end</PRE>
      <P>Note how little syntactic overhead is required to bury definitions in a 
      module.</P>
      <P>A plane is quantified by its normal vector and offset from the origin 
      away from the normal:</P>
<PRE>&gt; module Plane =
    type t = { normal: vector; offset: float };;
module Plane : begin
  type t = {normal: vector;
            offset: float;}
end</PRE>
      <P>A shape is a variant type containing either a sphere or a plane:</P>
<PRE>&gt; type shape =
    | Sphere of Sphere.t
    | Plane of Plane.t;;
type shape =
  | Sphere of Sphere.t
  | Plane of Plane.t</PRE>
      <P>A solid object is a shape and its material properties, including its 
      diffuse color, specular color and shininess, and the object's 
      reflectivity:</P>
<PRE>&gt; type solid =
      { diffuse: vector;
	specular: vector;
	shininess: float;
	reflectivity: float;
	geometry: shape };;
type solid = {diffuse: vector;
              specular: vector;
              shininess: float;
              reflectivity: float;
              geometry: shape;}</PRE>
      <P>Note that we reuse the built-in              <CODE>vector</CODE> type 
      to represent colors as well as spatial coordinates. This makes it easier 
      to perform arithmetic operations on colors, such as compositing the 
      contributions from different forms of lighting.           </P>
<PRE>&gt; type scene = { light: vector; solids: solid array };;
type scene = {light: vector;
              solids: solid array;}  </PRE>
      <P>The following              <CODE>normal</CODE> function computes the 
      normal vector of the given shape at the intersection point on the ray      
              <CODE>ray</CODE> at parameter              <CODE>lambda</CODE> :   
              </P>
<PRE>&gt; let normal ray lambda shape =
    let point = ray.orig + lambda $* ray.dir
    match shape with
    | Sphere sphere -&gt; normalize(point - sphere.Sphere.center)
    | Plane plane -&gt; plane.Plane.normal;;
val normal : ray -&gt; float -&gt; shape -&gt; Math.vector</PRE>
      <P>During ray tracing, a hit is quantified by the parameter along the ray 
      and the surface of the solid that was intersected:</P>
<PRE>&gt; type hit = { lambda: float; surface: solid option };;
type hit = {lambda: float;
            surface: solid option;}</PRE>
      <P>An option type is used because a ray that intersects nothing has an 
      infinite parameter              <CODE>lambda</CODE> and no surface.        
         </P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>intersect_aux</CODE> function tries to 
      intersect the given              <CODE>ray</CODE> with the given           
         <CODE>solid</CODE> , accumulating              <CODE>hit</CODE> (which 
      is updated only if a new intersection point is found that it closer than 
      the old intersection point given by the              <CODE>hit</CODE> 
      argument):           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let intersect_aux ray hit solid =
    let lambda =
      match solid.geometry with
      | Sphere sphere -&gt;
	  let v = sphere.Sphere.center - ray.orig

    if lambda &gt;= hit.lambda then hit else
      { lambda = lambda; surface = Some solid };;
val intersect_aux : ray -&gt; hit -&gt; solid -&gt; hit  </PRE>
      <P>The ray tracer must intersect every ray with the scene, which is a 
      sequence of solids, so an              <CODE>intersect</CODE> function 
      acts upon an array of solids and provides the              
      <CODE>intersect_aux</CODE> function with a base case for the              
      <CODE>hit</CODE> value with an infinite parametric intersection point      
              <CODE>lambda</CODE> that represents no intersection:           
</P>
<PRE>&gt; let intersect ray solids =
    Array.fold_left (intersect_aux ray) { lambda = infinity; surface = None } solids;;
val intersect : ray -&gt; solid array -&gt; hit</PRE>
      <P>The following              <CODE>is_lit</CODE> function casts a shadow 
      ray from the intersection point              <CODE>point</CODE> towards

      <P>The diffuse and specular contributions to the color are the results of

      recursively with a reflected ray in order to add the contribution from 
      reflections. To prevent infinite recursions, the weight of the current 
      contribution is taken into account and recursive calls are only 
      perpetuated if the weight is at least 0.1, providing a cut-off below which 
      reflections are neglected.           </P>

      <P>Note the use of an object expression to create an object value 
      indirectly from a class, augmenting it with new functionality. In this 
      case, the usual callback that paints the background gray is overridden to 
      do nothing in order to avoid flicker when the updated bitmap is blitted

      the              <CODE>Invalidate()</CODE> method of the form to get it 
      redrawn.           </P>
      <P>The following adds a callback to the              <CODE>Paint</CODE> 
      event that allocates the pixmap if one is not already available (i.e. if 
      this is the first time) or draws the current bitmap and ray traces a slice 
      of image:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; form.Paint.Add
    (fun e -&gt;
      if pixmap=null then invalidate() else
      let r = form.ClientRectangle
      let dest = new Rectangle(0, 0, r.Width, r.Height)
      let w, h = size()
      let src = new Rectangle(0, 0, w, h)
      e.Graphics.DrawImage(pixmap, dest, src, GraphicsUnit.Pixel)
      slice());;
val it : unit = ()</PRE>
      <P>Note that ray tracing a slice of image by calling the              
      <CODE>slice</CODE> function results in the invalidation of the form and, 
      therefore, the subsequent invocation of this              
      <CODE>Paint</CODE> callback until rendering is complete.           </P>
      <P>A main menu called              <CODE>menu</CODE> is defined and an 
      "Options" menu item is added to it:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let menu = new MainMenu();;
val menu : MainMenu
&gt; let options = menu.MenuItems.Add("Options");;
val edit : MenuItem</PRE>
      <P>The options menu is populated with three checked entries for the three 
      rendering options:</P>
<PRE>&gt; for item, opt in [options.MenuItems.Add("Specular"), Options.specular;
		    options.MenuItems.Add("Shadows"), Options.shadows; 
		    options.MenuItems.Add("Reflections"), Options.reflect] do
    item.Click.Add
      (fun _ -&gt;
	opt := not !opt
	item.Checked &lt;- !opt
	invalidate());;
val it : unit = ()</PRE>
      <P>The              <CODE>Click</CODE> event for each checked entry has a 
      callback registered that inverts the current state and reflects that in 
      the relevant option type from the              <CODE>Options</CODE> 
      module.           </P>
      <P>This menu is be added to the form with:</P>
<PRE>&gt; form.Menu &lt;- menu;;
val it : unit = ()</PRE>
      <P>These definitions cause a complete GUI application to be spawned from 
      the F# interactive session.</P>
      <H2>Screenshots</H2>
      <P>Despite its simplicity, this program can generate and visualize some 
      impressive images.</P>
      <P>The initial rendering is quite boring, showing only the four spheres 
      and plane with diffuse lighting:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Implementing%20a%20simple%20Ray%20Tracer_files/ray_tracer1.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>Using the drop down menu to enable different rendering options results 
      in more interesting images.</P>
      <P>Enabling specular reflection introduces sharp highlights where the 
      light reflects off each of the spheres:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Implementing%20a%20simple%20Ray%20Tracer_files/ray_tracer2.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>Enabling shadows introduces sharp shadows cast perfectly from each of 
      the spheres onto the other spheres and the planar floor:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Implementing%20a%20simple%20Ray%20Tracer_files/ray_tracer3.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>Finally, enabling reflections produces a much more compelling image 
      that is very difficult to generate realistically using other rendering 
      techniques:</P>
      <P>

      <H2>Conclusion</H2>
      <P>This program is an excellent starting point for many different avenues 
      of study:</P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>As a computationally-intensive program, this application is an ideal 
        candidate for optimization.</LI>
        <LI>As a non-trivial program, this program makes an excellent case study 
        for profiling.</LI>
        <LI>The current design is idiomatic functional programming but object 
        orientation provides a competitive alternative for this particular 
        application.</LI>
        <LI>F#'s expressive static type system can be used to structure this 
        code in various ways in order to exploit static checking and catch more 
        bugs.</LI>
        <LI>Although cooperative multitasking is adequate for this 
        implementation, a more general approach is to use a worker thread to run 
        the GUI and computation concurrently.</LI>
        <LI>Performance could be improved via parallelism by exploiting multiple 
        cores and CPUs using multiple worker threads with "work 
      stealing".</LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>These topics will all be covered in future F#.NET Journal articles.</P>
