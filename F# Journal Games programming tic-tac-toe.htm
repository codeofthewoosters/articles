      <H1>Games programming: tic-tac-toe</H1>
      <P>The game tic-tac-toe, known as Noughts and Crosses in the UK, is one of 
      the simplest popular board games. This article describes an F# program 
      that uses artificial intelligence to provide an infallible computer 
      player, Windows Presentation Foundation to provide a graphical user 
      interface for the desktop and threading to maintain a fluid user 
      experience as the computer thinks about its next move.</P>
      <P>We begin by referencing the DLLs required to use WPF and              
      <CODE>System.Func</CODE> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; #r "PresentationCore.dll";;
--&gt; Referenced 'C:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\
Framework\v3.0\PresentationCore.dll'</PRE>
<PRE>&gt; #r "PresentationFramework.dll";;
--&gt; Referenced 'C:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\
Framework\v3.0\PresentationFramework.dll'</PRE>
<PRE>&gt; #r "WindowsBase.dll";;
--&gt; Referenced 'C:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\
Framework\v3.0\WindowsBase.dll'</PRE>
<PRE>&gt; #r "System.Core.dll";;
--&gt; Referenced 'c:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\
Framework\v3.5\System.Core.dll'</PRE>
      <P>The program will make heavy use of the following namespaces:</P>
<PRE>&gt; open System.Windows;;
&gt; open System.Windows.Threading;;
&gt; open System.Threading;;</PRE>
      <P>We begin with a simple union type containing the two different players 
      in the game:</P>
<PRE>&gt; type player = O | X;;
type player =
  | O
  | X</PRE>
      <P>We could have used a type to represent the state of a board position 
      that included an              <CODE>Empty</CODE> union case but, instead, 
      we shall represent the state of a board position using the              
      <CODE>player option</CODE> type.           </P>
      <P>The game AI requires the ability to determine the state of a board as 
      either in-play, a draw (the board is full but nobody has won) and wins for 
      O or X. In order to provide feedback, we shall keep the positions of the 
      winning line in this union type:</P>
<PRE>&gt; type state =
    | Playing
    | Draw
    | OWins of (int * int) list
    | XWins of (int * int) list;;
type state =
  | Playing
  | Draw
  | OWins of (int * int) list
  | XWins of (int * int) list</PRE>
      <P>Next, we require a function that, given a board, returns the state of 
      the board as a value of this              <CODE>state</CODE> type:         
        </P>
<PRE>&gt; let checkBoard (board: player option [] []) =
    let rec loop = function
      | [] when Seq.forall (Seq.forall Option.isSome) board -&gt; Draw
      | [] -&gt; Playing
      | ps::pss -&gt;
          match [for i, j in ps -&gt; board.[i].[j]] with
          | [Some X; Some X; Some X] -&gt; XWins ps
          | [Some O; Some O; Some O] -&gt; OWins ps
          | _ -&gt; loop pss
    loop
      [ for i in 0..2 do
          yield [i, 0; i, 1; i, 2]
          yield [0, i; 1, i; 2, i]
        yield [0, 0; 1, 1; 2, 2]
        yield [0, 2; 1, 1; 2, 0] ];;
val checkBoard : player option [] [] -&gt; state</PRE>
      <P>This              <CODE>checkBoard</CODE> function is remarkably 
      concise thanks to the use of sequence expressions to build a list of lines 
      of board positions that win a game and a nested recursive              
      <CODE>loop</CODE> function that uses pattern matching to test each line to 
      see if either O or X has won.           </P>
      <P>Note that the board is represented as an array of arrays, primarily 
      because arrays implement the              <CODE>IEnumerable</CODE> 
      interface (allowing us to use the              <CODE>Seq</CODE> module) 
      whereas 2D arrays do not.           </P>
      <P>The AI is essentially encapsulated in the following pair of 
      mutually-recursive functions,              <CODE>minimax</CODE> and        
            <CODE>best</CODE> , that score potential moves and accumulate the 
      best move for the computer to make:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec minimax ((_, f as a), b) (board: _ [] []) =
    match checkBoard board with
    | OWins _ -&gt; 1
    | Draw -&gt; 0
    | XWins _ -&gt; -1
    | Playing -&gt; best (a, b) board |&gt; f
  and best ((player, _ as a), b) (board: _ [] []) =
    [ for i in 0..2 do
        for j in 0..2 do
          if Option.isNone board.[i].[j] then
            let board = Array.map Array.copy board
            board.[i].[j] &lt;- Some player
            yield minimax (b, a) board, (i, j) ];;
val minimax :
  (player * ((int * (int * int)) list -&gt; int)) *
  (player * ((int * (int * int)) list -&gt; int)) -&gt; player option [] [] -&gt; int
val best :
  (player * ((int * (int * int)) list -&gt; int)) *
  (player * ((int * (int * int)) list -&gt; int)) -&gt;
    player option [] [] -&gt; (int * (int * int)) list</PRE>
      <P>Note that the inferred types are substantial but type inference means 
      that they do not clutter the source code.</P>
      <P>The              <CODE>minimax</CODE> function checks the board state 
      and gives base case scores for wins and draws or uses the              
      <CODE>best</CODE> function to calculate the scores of possible moves if 
      the game is still in play.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>best</CODE> function uses a sequence expression 
      to create a list of possible moves and their scores.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>minimax</CODE> and              
      <CODE>best</CODE> functions pass pairs of the player and a function        
            <CODE>f</CODE> that is used to find the best move of a list of 
      scored moves. In particular, the pairs              <CODE>a</CODE> and     
               <CODE>b</CODE> are reversed in order to move one player after the 
      other and chose good moves for whichever player is making the move (rather 
      than having both players playing for O to win!). Note the use of named 
      subpatterns:              <CODE>(_, f as a)</CODE> to bind the name        
            <CODE>a</CODE> to the pair.           </P>
      <P>The WPF              <CODE>Application</CODE> is required not only by 
      the main GUI code in this program but also by the AI code in order for the 
      computer to make a move (on the UI thread) when it has found its preferred 
      move. There are several ways to share the required functionality but the 
      most elegant is to have a single lazily evaluated global              
      <CODE>Application</CODE> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let application = lazy(Application());;
val application : Lazy&lt;System.Windows.Application&gt; =
  System.Windows.Application</PRE>
      <P>This is lazily evaluated because it must be constructed on a thread 
      running in Single Threaded Apartment (STA) mode. So the lazy thunk will 
      have its evaluation forced first by the main function and then whenever it 
      is needed to obtain a              <CODE>Dispatcher</CODE> in order to 
      inject code into the message queue to be run on the UI thread.           
      </P>
      <P>Note that              <CODE>Lazy</CODE> automatically handles thread 
      safety for use, ensuring that the              <CODE>Application</CODE> 
      class will only ever be constructed once. Moreover, the implementation of 
      the              <CODE>Lazy</CODE> type in the F# standard library uses 
      non-blocking algorithms to ensure that subsequent reads are very fast.     
            </P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>runUI</CODE> function wraps the        
            <CODE>Dispatcher</CODE> in order to make it as easy as possible to 
      run arbitrary F# functions on the UI thread:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let runUI (f: _ -&gt; _) =
    let f = System.Func&lt;_, _&gt;(f)
    let priority = DispatcherPriority.Normal
    application.Force().Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(priority, f, null)
    |&gt; ignore;;
val runUI : ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; unit</PRE>
      <P>Note the elegant use of first-class functions here.</P>
      <P>The logic has been written in idiomatic OCaml style with union types 
      and pattern matching. However, the GUI part of the program is best written 
      in object oriented style, by deriving a new              
      <CODE>Board</CODE> class from the WPF              
      <CODE>Controls.Grid</CODE> class and filling the grid with buttons that 
      respond to user input:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; type Board() as grid =
    inherit Controls.Grid(Margin=Thickness 11.0)</PRE>
      <P>The              <CODE>Board</CODE> contains a              
      <CODE>player option array array</CODE> called              
      <CODE>board</CODE> to store which player (if any) has played at each board 
      position:           </P>
<PRE>    let board : player option [] [] =
      Array.init 3 (fun _ -&gt; Array.create 3 None)</PRE>
      <P>And a              <CODE>Controls.Button [,]</CODE> called              
      <CODE>button</CODE> that stores the UI buttons representing each board 
      position:           </P>
<PRE>    let button =
      Array2D.init 3 3 (fun _ _ -&gt; Controls.Button())</PRE>
      <P>More sophisticated programs might separate out              
      <CODE>board</CODE> and              <CODE>buttons</CODE> as model and view 
      in a design pattern but this program is sufficiently simple that it is not 
      worth doing.           </P>
      <P>Next, we shall use a              <CODE>glow</CODE> function to 
      highlight a winning line (if any) and put up a dialog notifying the user 
      of the state of play at the end of the game:           </P>
<PRE>    let glow (str: string) ps =
      let background = button.[0, 0].Background
      for i, j in ps do
        button.[i, j].Background &lt;- Media.Brushes.Salmon
      let ok = MessageBoxButton.OK
      let image = MessageBoxImage.Information
      MessageBox.Show(str, "Tic Tac Toe", ok, image) |&gt; ignore
      for i, j in ps do
        button.[i, j].Background &lt;- background
      grid.Clear()</PRE>
      <P>Both the functions dealing with human and computer moves will require 
      the ability to handle completed games in the same way (using the           
         <CODE>glow</CODE> function) so this commonality is factored into a      
              <CODE>check</CODE> function:           </P>
<PRE>    let check k =
      match checkBoard board with
      | Draw -&gt; glow "Draw!" []
      | OWins ps -&gt; glow "I win!" ps
      | XWins ps -&gt; glow "You win!" ps
      | Playing -&gt; k()</PRE>
      <P>Note that the              <CODE>check</CODE> function has been written 
      using a continuation              <CODE>k</CODE> so that the caller can 
      specify the behaviour invoked when the board is found to be still in play. 
                </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>Board</CODE> class contains a mutable            
        <CODE>turn</CODE> describing which player is expected to play next:      
           </P>
<PRE>    let mutable turn = X</PRE>
      <P>Mutable values can be a nightmare in the context of multithreaded 
      programs such as this one but, in this case, the              
      <CODE>turn</CODE> variable will only ever be mutated by code running on 
      the UI thread.           </P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>computerMove</CODE> function uses the  
                  <CODE>best</CODE> function to find the optimal move for the 
      computer to play and then queues work on the message loop of the UI thread 
      to play the computer's move, change              <CODE>turn</CODE> to the 
      human player and check the board:           </P>
<PRE>    let computerMove () =
      let _, (i, j) =
        best ((O, fst &lt;&lt; Seq.max), (X, fst &lt;&lt; Seq.min)) board |&gt; Seq.max
      runUI(fun _ -&gt;
        grid.[i, j] &lt;- Some O
        turn &lt;- X
        check (fun () -&gt; ()))</PRE>
      <P>Similarly, the              <CODE>humanMove</CODE> function checks that 
      the desired move is available, plays the move, changes              
      <CODE>turn</CODE> to the computer player, checks the board and, if the 
      game is still in play, starts searching for a computer move in the thread 
      pool (while the UI thread is free to continue animating and responding to 
      user input):           </P>
<PRE>    let humanMove (i, j) =
      match grid.[i,j] with
      | Some(O | X) -&gt; ()
      | None -&gt;
          grid.[i,j] &lt;- Some X
          turn &lt;- O
          check (fun () -&gt;
            ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(fun _ -&gt; computerMove())
            |&gt; ignore)</PRE>
      <P>The construction of the              <CODE>Board</CODE> class occurs in 
      a              <CODE>do</CODE> block and simply initializes the GUI 
      elements including registering a callback for the              
      <CODE>Click</CODE> event of each button that makes a move for the human if 
      it is the human's turn:           </P>
<PRE>    do
      for i in 0..2 do
        let column = Controls.ColumnDefinition()
        column.Width &lt;- GridLength 30.0
        grid.ColumnDefinitions.Add column
        let row = Controls.RowDefinition()
        row.Height &lt;- GridLength 30.0
        grid.RowDefinitions.Add row

          grid.Children.Add button |&gt; ignore
          button.Click.Add(fun _ -&gt; if turn=X then humanMove (i, j))</PRE>
      <P>Finally, the              <CODE>Board</CODE> class provides some 
      helpful member functions. Indexing is used with a getter and setter to 
      allow board positions to be read and set:           </P>
<PRE>    member grid.Item
      with get (i, j) = board.[i].[j]
      and set (i, j) x =

          match x with
          | None -&gt; ""
          | Some O -&gt; "O"
          | Some X -&gt; "X"</PRE>
      <P>Note that setting a board position not only sets an element of          
          <CODE>board</CODE> but also sets the              <CODE>Content</CODE> 
      of the appropriate              <CODE>Button</CODE> to a string.           
      </P>
      <P>A              <CODE>Clear</CODE> member is provided to clear the board 
      and reset              <CODE>turn</CODE> to the human player:           
      </P>
<PRE>    member grid.Clear() =
      for i in 0..2 do
        for j in 0..2 do

    member Item : i:int * j:int -&gt; player option with get
    member Item : i:int * j:int -&gt; player option with set
  end</PRE>
      <P>The main program simply places the              <CODE>Board</CODE> in a 
                   <CODE>Viewbox</CODE> in a              <CODE>Window</CODE>

      <H2>Results</H2>
      <P>When run, the above program produces a GUI application that allows the 
      user to move by clicking on board positions and makes computer moves 
      automatically without blocking the UI thread, giving a fluid user 
      experience:</P>

      <H2>Summary</H2>
      <P>This article has described a simple program to play the game 
      tic-tac-toe including a computer player. The graphical user interface used 
      Windows Presentation and, in particular, made use of its vector graphics 
      capabilities. The time required to compute a move for the computer was 
      significant enough that it was worth doing the computation in the thread 
      pool to free the UI thread up and give the user a more fluid 
      experience.</P>
      <P>Future F#.NET Journal articles will revisit some of the topics covered 
      in this article including artificial intelligence, asynchronous GUI 
      programming and the creation of progressively more sophisticated computer 
      games.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
