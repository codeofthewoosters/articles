      <H1>Solving the Traveling Salesman problem using Simulated Annealing</H1>
      <P>Finding global minima of an arbitrary function is a significantly more 
      challenging problem than local function minimization and has many 
      practical applications from the simulation of molecules to the design of 
      printed circuit board layouts. Several different global function 
      minimization algorithms exist, many of which make repeated use of local 
      function-minimization algorithms. This article describes a simple and 
      elegant solution to the traveling salesman problem that uses the simulated 
      annealing approach to global function minimization. The results are 
      visualized in real time using Windows Presentation Foundation. In 
      particular, we show how the purely functional use of data structures 
      facilitates an efficient lock-free way to obtain recent results for 
      visualization.</P>
      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P>The traveling salesman problem is a combinatorial optimization problem: 
      given a network of vertices and weighted edges between them, find the path 
      that minimizes the sum of the weights along the edges on the path. The 
      weights are usually some form of distance, such as the Euclidean distance 
      between a pair of points in two or three dimensions or the great-circle 
      distance between two points on the surface of a sphere.</P>
      <P>For a handful of vertices, this problem can be solved directly by 
      evaluating the lengths of all possible path permutations. However, this 
      quickly becomes intractable and, for large numbers of vertices, no known 
      method is able to identify the shortest path conclusively. Fortunately, 
      there are a variety of randomized algorithms for global function 
      minimization that can provide an arbitrarily accurate approximation to the 
      shortest path.</P>
      <P>Simulated annealing is a simple approach to global function 
      minimization that, as the name implies, draws upon the natural process of 
      annealing where particles jostle randomly at high temperatures but begin 
      to favor positions that lower energy as the temperature is reduced. This 
      article describes a simple program that uses simulated annealing to find a 
      short path around a large number of vertices.</P>
      <H2>Simulated annealing</H2>
      <P>As always we begin by turning on the #light syntax option:</P>
<PRE>&gt; #light;;</PRE>
      <P>The following references are required when entering the program from an 
      interactive session:</P>
<PRE>&gt; #r "FSharp.PowerPack.dll";;
&gt; #I "C:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\v3.0";;
&gt; #r "WindowsBase.dll";;
&gt; #r "PresentationCore.dll";;
&gt; #r "PresentationFramework.dll";;</PRE>
      <P>Otherwise, the same assemblies must be referenced using the solution 
      explorer pane when building a Visual Studio project for batch 
      compilation.</P>
      <P>We shall make extensive use of definitions from the following 
      namespaces:</P>
<PRE>&gt; open System;;
&gt; open System.Windows;;
&gt; open System.Windows.Media;;
&gt; open System.Windows.Threading;;
&gt; open System.Threading;;
&gt; open Microsoft.FSharp.Math;;</PRE>
      <P>This program will use one simulation thread and one visualization 
      thread. The simulation thread requires a random number generator so we 
      shall use a single global one in this case:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let random = new System.Random();;
val random : System.Random</PRE>
      <P>The following              <CODE>rand</CODE> function generates a 
      number randomly distributed across the range 0..n-1 and always returns 0 
      if n=0:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rand = function 0 -&gt; 0 | n -&gt; random.Next(n);;
val rand : int -&gt; int</PRE>
      <P>The              <CODE>except</CODE>  function ensures that a random 
      number              <CODE>j</CODE> is not equal to              
      <CODE>i</CODE> by returning the successive integer if j &gt;= i:           
      </P>
<PRE>&gt; let except i j = if j &gt;= i then j+1 else j;;
val except : int -&gt; int -&gt; int</PRE>
      <P>The              <CODE>rand_except</CODE> function uses the             
       <CODE>rand</CODE> and              <CODE>except</CODE> functions to 
      generate a random number in the range 0..n-1 that is not              
      <CODE>i</CODE> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rand_except i n = except i (rand(n-1));;
val rand_except : int -&gt; int -&gt; int</PRE>
      <P>The              <CODE>vertex</CODE> array is initialized to an 
      interesting randomized distribution of points for our salesman to 
      circumnavigate:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let vertex =
    let f _ =
      let z = 2. * random.NextDouble() - 1.
      let t = 2. * System.Math.PI * random.NextDouble()

      0.5 * vector [1. + r * sin t; 1. + r * cos t]
    Array.init 1024 f;;
val vertex : Vector&lt;float&gt; []</PRE>
      <P>In this case, we derive the number of vertices from the vertex array 
      because a more general program would read an arbitrary number of vertices 
      in from elsewhere:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let n = Array.length vertex;;
val n : int</PRE>
      <P>The data structure at the core of this program is represented by the

  end</PRE>
      <P>This              <CODE>Path</CODE> class uses a single implicit        
            <CODE>Path</CODE> constructor that accepts the number of vertices    
                <CODE>n</CODE> and optionally an              <CODE>Index</CODE> 
      function that converts an index into the path to an index into the         
           <CODE>vertex</CODE> array and a              <CODE>Length</CODE> 
      number that is the current length of the path.           </P>
      <P>Although the              <CODE>Path</CODE> class uses mutable arrays 
      they are never mutated and, consequently, this representation of paths is 
      a purely functional data structure. A trivial consequence of this is that 
      all operations are thread safe and that safety is exploited later in this 
      program to evade the use of costly locks when sharing data between 
      threads.           </P>
      <P>The local              <CODE>index</CODE> value is the function used to 
      index the vertices along the path and defaults to the identity function if 
      a function is not specified via the              <CODE>Index</CODE> 
      optional argument to the constructor.           </P>
      <P>The local              <CODE>length</CODE> value is the length of the 
      path and is computed explicitly if the optional              
      <CODE>Length</CODE> argument was not specified.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>Item</CODE> member is used to let the notation   
                 <CODE>path.[i]</CODE> be used to obtain the index of the vertex 
      at position              <CODE>i</CODE> on the path.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>Vertex</CODE> member uses the              
      <CODE>Item</CODE> member to look the actual vertex position up in the      
              <CODE>vertex</CODE> array.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>Edge</CODE> member gives the distance between 
      two vertices on the path, defaulting to zero if either argument is out of 
      range.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>Alter</CODE> member returns a new path with an 
      additional indirection of the indices and an updated length.           
</P>
      <P>The              <CODE>Flatten</CODE> member returns a new path that 
      represents the same path as the current path but the current sequence of 
      indirections to obtain an index into the              <CODE>vertex</CODE> 
      array is replaced with a direct O(1) array lookup. This is used to keep 
      the number of indirections and, consequently, the performance of index 
      lookup under control.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>Vertices</CODE> member returns an array of the 
      vertices in order along the path.           </P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>Rotate</CODE> module represents 
      rotations of the path that have the effect of moving the "open" path 
      segment between the last and first vertices on the path:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; module Rotate =

end</PRE>
      <P>The internal              <CODE>rotate_cost</CODE> function determines 
      how much a rotation by              <CODE>i</CODE> would increase the path 
      length.           </P>
      <P>The internal              <CODE>rotate</CODE> function rotates the 
      indices by              <CODE>i</CODE> .           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>at_random</CODE> function generates a random 
      rotation by 1..n-1 indices, returning the cost and a function that would 
      perform the rotation.           </P>
      <P>Similarly, the              <CODE>Reverse</CODE> module encapsulates

end</PRE>
      <P>The functions serve the same roles as those in the              
      <CODE>Rotate</CODE> module but, in this case, the two parameters           
         <CODE>i</CODE> and              <CODE>j</CODE> represent reversal of 
      the indices [i..j] in the path.           </P>
      <P>The third and final form of mutation handled by this program is the 
      splicing of a run of indices from [i, j) into k to form new vertices 
      [k..k-i+j) as implemented by the following              
      <CODE>Splice</CODE> module:           </P>

      <P>The              <CODE>f</CODE> function removes the semi-inclusive 
      range of indices [i, j). As before, the              
      <CODE>splice_cost</CODE> function determines the increase in path length 
      that a splice would incur, the              <CODE>splice</CODE> function

      <P>Note how rotation involved two edges in its cost calculation, reversal

      of the operation but still only affecting a small number of edges despite 
      irrespective of the number of indices altered.</P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>random_mutation</CODE> randomly

      <P>The              <CODE>OnRender</CODE> method simply obtains an array 
      of the vertices along the path and renders red lines between the black 
      dots at each vertex.           </P>
      <P>Finally, the main program creates a window containing an object of our  
                  <CODE>Viewport</CODE> class, registers a callback that causes 
      the visualization to be redrawn aggressively, spawns the              
      <CODE>simulate</CODE> function on a background thread and begins the GUI 
      application:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; do
    let viewport = Viewport(Margin=Thickness 11.)
    let window = Window(Title="Traveling Salesman", Content=viewport)
    let rendering_handler o e =
      viewport.InvalidateVisual()
    CompositionTarget.add_Rendering(new EventHandler(rendering_handler))

      <P>When compiled, this definition can be preceded with              
      <CODE>[&lt;STAThread&gt;]</CODE> to ensure that the main program thread is 
      in single-threaded apartment mode.           </P>
      <H2>Results</H2>
      <P>The vertices are laid out randomly within a circle with a bias towards 
      the edges of the circle. An initially random path is mutated and shorter 
      paths gradually become more likely to be chosen until the path length is 
      minimized and a more ordered and efficient path appears:</P>

      <H2>Low-level interpretation</H2>
      <P>Readers not yet familiar with functional programming will benefit from 
      a more low-level interpretation of how this program operates. 
      Specifically, what are the implications of composing              
      <CODE>index</CODE> functions?           </P>
      <P>The answer is that repeatedly replacing the              
      <CODE>index</CODE> function with a composition of an old              
      <CODE>index</CODE> function and a new              <CODE>index</CODE> 
      function has the effect of building a sequence of closures that are 
      represented internally as a linked list, with one closure's environment 
      pointing to the next closure. When the current              
      <CODE>index</CODE> function is invoked it invokes the next closure in the 
      list and adjusts the returned value to represent the operation that it 
      performs (e.g. rotating the path by applying modulo arithmetic to the 
      index). The base case is the default provided by the              
      <CODE>Path</CODE> class that is the identity function that simply returns 
      the path 0..n-1.           </P>
      <H2>Summary</H2>
      <P>This article has described an elegant and yet efficient implementation 
      of the simulated annealing method that is designed to solve the traveling 
      salesman problem. In particular, the use of a purely functional 
      representation of the path (that made internal use of an array without 
      mutating it) allowed a real-time visualization to obtain self-consistent 
      paths from the concurrently-running solver without the need for 
    locks.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
