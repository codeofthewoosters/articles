      <H1>Emergent behaviour: flocking boids</H1>
      <P>Artificial life became a popular topic in the 1980s. In particular, 
      with the discovery that simple rules defining the behaviour of individuals 
      could give rise to sophisticated behaviour of groups of individuals. This 
      unexpected result was described as "emergent behaviour" and one of the 
      most famous examples was a computer program called "Boids" that used only 
      three simple rules to govern the dynamics of individuals but produced 
      remarkably realistic flocking behaviour of the population as a whole. This 
      article describes an interactive boids simulator with a graphical user 
      interface implemented using Windows Presentation Foundation.</P>
      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P>Artificial life is a term used to describe man-made constructions that 
      try to replicate biological phenomena. In particular, soft articifial life 
      is used to describe computer simulations that run in virtual worlds and 
      use visualization to convey how realistically they can mimic the natural 
      world. This goes a step beyond physical simulations like photorealistic 
      rendering using ray tracers, to actually trying to recreate              
      <I>behaviour</I> observed in real organisms.           </P>
      <P>Flocking is a non-trivial behaviour observed in groups of many 
      different kinds of organisms, including birds, fish, bacteria, and 
      insects.</P>
      <P>The boids simulation published by              <A href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">Craig 
      Reynolds</A> in 1986 used the following three simple steering behaviours 
      to describe how each individual boid maneuvers based on the positions and 
      velocities of its neighbors:           </P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates.</LI>
        <LI>Alignment: steer towards the average heading of local 
        flockmates.</LI>
        <LI>Cohesion: steer to move toward the average position of local 
        flockmates.</LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>Cohesion and separation are also seen in molecular dynamics. For 
      example, the Lennard-Jones pair potential approximates the interactions of 
      Argon atoms and includes a long-range attraction and a short-range 
      repulsion, giving rise to an energy minimum at an equilibrium separation. 
      In terms of boids, this might be considered as a long-range desire to hang 
      about in a group of boids but a short-range repulsion to avoid crashing 
      into neighboring boids.</P>
      <P>Alignment turns out to be the key to getting emergent behaviour in 
      boids and, in particular, is the difference between the swarming of bees, 
      where the desire for alignment is weak:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Emergent%20behaviour%20flocking%20boids_files/swarm_bees.jpg"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>Whereas schools of fish can have very strong alignment:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Emergent%20behaviour%20flocking%20boids_files/school_fish.jpg"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>As we shall see, flocking of birds lies between these two extremes.</P>
      <H2>Implementation</H2>
      <P>An F# program to simulate the dynamics of a flock based upon the above 
      rules may be written as follows:</P>
<PRE>&gt; #light;;</PRE>
      <P>We shall use the Windows Presentation Library from .NET 3.0 and beyond 
      for visualization. So we begin by referencing the following DLLs when 
      running the program interactively:</P>
<PRE>&gt; #r "PresentationCore.dll";;
&gt; #r "PresentationFramework.dll";;
&gt; #r "WindowsBase.dll";;</PRE>
      <P>Alternatively, these DLLs may be referenced from the Solution Explorer 
      pane of Visual Studio when compiling an application.</P>
      <P>We shall use the following three namespaces extensively:</P>
<PRE>&gt; open System;;
&gt; open System.Windows;;
&gt; open System.Windows.Media;;</PRE>
      <P>The program begins by defining a few global variables used to control 
      the size of the population:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let mutable n_boids = 100;;
val mutable n_boids : int</PRE>
      <P>the strength of the cohesion force that pulls boids together:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let mutable cohesion = 1.0;;
val mutable cohesion : float</PRE>
      <P>the strength of the separation force that pushes them apart when they 
      get very close:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let mutable separation = 1000.0;;
val mutable separation : float</PRE>
      <P>and the strength of alignment that controls how strongly they desire to 
      point in the same direction as their neighbors:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let mutable alignment = 1000.0;;
val mutable alignment : float</PRE>
      <P>Finally, we shall also include a target location that the boids are 
      attracted to:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let mutable target = Point(0.0, 0.0);;
val mutable target : Point</PRE>
      <P>The flock is represented by the following array that contains the 
      position and velocity vectors for every boid in the flock:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let mutable boid =
    let rand = System.Random()
    [|for _ in 1 .. n_boids -&gt;
        Point(1000. * rand.NextDouble(),
        1000. * rand.NextDouble()), Vector(0.0, 0.0)|];;
val mutable boid : (Point * Vector) array</PRE>
      <P>In this case, we shall update the simulation from the visualization 
      which will, in turn, be redrawn by the rendering loop. Consequently, we 
      should perform each simulation step based upon the amount of real time 
      that has passed, using the following timer:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let time = System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch();;
val time : Diagnostics.Stopwatch</PRE>
      <P>The following              <CODE>update</CODE> function is responsible 
      for updating the positions and velocities of each boid in the flock:       
          </P>
<PRE>&gt; let update() =
    let dt = float time.ElapsedMilliseconds / 1e3
    time.Reset()
    time.Start()
    for i=0 to n_boids-1 do
      let p0, v0 = boid.[i]
      let p0 = p0 + dt * v0
      let home = target - p0
      let v0 = v0 + 1. / (1. + home.Length) * home
      boid.[i] &lt;- p0 + dt * v0, v0
      for j=0 to i-1 do
        let (p0, v0), (p1, v1) = boid.[i], boid.[j]
        let dp = p1 - p0
        let sep = 1. + dp.Length
        let u (v: Vector) = 1. / v.Length * v
        let dv =
          cohesion / sep ** 2.0 * dp +
            alignment * (u v1 - u v0) / sep ** 3.0 -
            separation / sep ** 4.0 * dp
        let dampen (v: Vector) =
          let speed = max 10. (min 100. v.Length)
          speed / v.Length * v
        boid.[i] &lt;- p0, dampen(v0 + dt * dv)
        boid.[j] &lt;- p1, dampen(v1 - dt * dv);;
val update : unit -&gt; unit</PRE>
      <P>This function begins by calculating the time elapsed since it was last 
      invoked and then loops over each boid updating its dynamics. In this case, 
      we have adopted the simplest possible O(n             <SUP>2</SUP> ) 
      algorithm that considers every boid in the context of every other boid. 
      Note that double counting is avoided by looping the inner loop over 
      0..i-1.           </P>
      <P>The outer loop begins by updating the position of each boid according 
      to its velocity and adding the attraction to the              
      <CODE>target</CODE> (that will be the mouse coordinate).           </P>
      <P>The inner loop obtains the positions and velocities for both the        
            <CODE>i</CODE> th and              <CODE>j</CODE> th boids and then 
      calculates the displacement              <CODE>dp</CODE> between them and 
      the separation              <CODE>sep</CODE> . The separation is 
      incremented in order to prevent subsequent calculations from blowing up 
      when a pair of boids are very close. A nested function              
      <CODE>u</CODE> is defined that returns a normalized vector. The 
      acceleration              <CODE>dv</CODE> is the sum of components due to 
      cohesion, alignment and separation. The cohesion is a simple inverse 
      square law that attracts boids to each other. The alignment adjust the 
      current velocity vector to direct it toward that of the neighbor, using 
      the normalized velocity vectors, and the effect decays with the cube of 
      the separation. Finally, the separation force is similar to the cohesive 
      force but with the opposite sign and using a fourth power. So the 
      separation force falls off very quickly as the distance increases but is 
      much larger for small separations, achieving a kind of hard core 
      repulsion.           </P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>View</CODE> class provides a WPF 
      control that visualizes the current state of the simulation by drawing 
      pointed lines representing the position and velocity of each boid:         
        </P>
<PRE>&gt; type View() as this =
    inherit Controls.Control()</PRE>
<PRE>    let update (this: FrameworkElement) _ _ =
      update()
      this.InvalidateVisual()
    
    do
      CompositionTarget.add_Rendering(new EventHandler(update this))
    
    override this.OnRender dc =
      let pen = Pen(Brushes.Black, 5.)
      pen.EndLineCap &lt;- PenLineCap.Triangle
      for i=0 to n_boids-1 do
        let p, v = boid.[i]
        dc.DrawLine(pen, p, p + 0.01 * v);;
type View =
  class
    inherit Controls.Control
    new : unit -&gt; View
    override OnRender : dc:DrawingContext -&gt; unit
  end</PRE>
      <P>Note that the (implicit) constructor of this class also registers a 
      nested             <CODE>update</CODE> function to be called at every 
      render event. This function calls the outer              
      <CODE>update</CODE> function before invalidating the control, causing 
      repeated redraw.           </P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>add</CODE> function is a helper 
      function used to add controls to a panel:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let add (panel: Controls.Panel) control =
    panel.Children.Add control |&gt; ignore
    control;;
val add : Controls.Panel -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a when 'a :&gt; UIElement</PRE>
      <P>Finally, the main program is run in single-threaded apartment mode and 
      creates the GUI, defining the callbacks for the controls and runs the 
      application:</P>
<PRE>&gt; [&lt;STAThread&gt;]
  do
    let vbox = Controls.StackPanel()
    vbox.Margin &lt;- Thickness 11.
    Controls.Label( Content="Controls",
                    FontWeight=FontWeights.Bold,
                    HorizontalAlignment=HorizontalAlignment.Center )
    |&gt; add vbox |&gt; ignore
    let space = Thickness(0., 0., 0., 11.)
    let slider text x0 x x1 f =
      Controls.Label(Content=text) |&gt; add vbox |&gt; ignore
      let control = Controls.Slider(Margin=space) |&gt; add vbox
      control.Minimum &lt;- x0
      control.Maximum &lt;- x1
      control.ValueChanged.Add(fun x -&gt; f x.NewValue)
      control.Value &lt;- x
    slider "Population:" 1. (float n_boids) (float n_boids)
      (fun x -&gt; n_boids &lt;- int x)
    slider "Cohesion:" 0. cohesion 10. (fun x -&gt; cohesion &lt;- x)
    slider "Separation:" 0. separation 1000. (fun x -&gt; separation &lt;- x)
    slider "Alignment:" 0. alignment 1000. (fun x -&gt; alignment &lt;- x)
    
    let hbox = Controls.DockPanel()
    Controls.DockPanel.SetDock(vbox, Controls.Dock.Right)
    hbox.Children.Add vbox |&gt; ignore
    hbox.Children.Add (View()) |&gt; ignore
    
    let window = Window(Title="Flocking boids")
    window.Content &lt;- hbox
    window.MouseMove.Add(fun e -&gt; target &lt;- e.GetPosition window)
    
    (Application()).Run window
    |&gt; ignore;;</PRE>
      <P>This section of code implements a more sophisticated GUI than we have 
      seen before in The F#.NET Journal, creating a split window with several 
      interactive slides, labels and a header. The amount of code required to 
      define this GUI is remarkably small thanks to several features of the F# 
      programming language.</P>
      <P>Properties are set in calls to object contructors such as              
      <CODE>Controls.Label</CODE> . This gives the illusion of declarative style 
      even though WPF is heavily imperative by design.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>add</CODE> helper function makes it easy to add 
      controls into any given panel. In particular, currying this function 
      allows the parent panel control to be partially applied and the resulting 
      closure can be passed to the built-in              <CODE>|&gt;</CODE> 
      operator in order to add a control to a panel and keep its value. This is 
      used inside the              <CODE>slider</CODE> function to add the 
      slider before setting several of its properties.           </P>
      <P>Nested functions make it trivial to factor out functionality. In this 
      case, the nested              <CODE>slider</CODE> function adds two 
      controls, a label and then a slider, and initializes the relevant 
      properties of the slider. This is used for four different sliders, saving 
      code space. Moreover, nested relieves us from even having to consider that 
      our              <CODE>slider</CODE> function silently captured variables 
      from its environment.           </P>
      <H2>Results</H2>
      <P>This simple program allows us to simulate a variety of flocking 
      behaviours. High cohesion but low separation and alignment can be used to 
      simulate a swarm that resembles the behaviour of flying insects:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Emergent%20behaviour%20flocking%20boids_files/swarm.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>Stronger alignment produces emergent behaviour similar to that of 
      flocking birds, where different parts of a single flock may be moving in 
      different directions:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Emergent%20behaviour%20flocking%20boids_files/flock.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>Finally, strong alignment create behaviour closer to that of some 
      schools of fish, with a much more uniform distribution of positions and 
      very similar directions:</P>

      <H2>Summary</H2>
      <P>This article has demonstrate how F# makes it easy to construct simple 
      programs that simulate and visualize complex dynamics.</P>
      <P>Future F#.NET Journal articles will revisit the subjects of artificial
