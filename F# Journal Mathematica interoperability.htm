      <H1>Mathematica interoperability</H1>
      <P>The Mathematica integrated technical computing environment from Wolfram 
      Research is an incredibly powerful cross platform development environment, 
      language and enormous standard library specifically designed for technical 
      computing. Mathematica's .NET-Link technology is designed to allow 
      Mathematica programs to interoperate with .NET languages such as C#. This 
      article examines the hugely productive marriage of the F# programming 
      language with Mathematica and demonstrates how Mathematica can be 
      controlled entirely from F# programs, allowing Mathematica's awesome 
      functionality to be tapped from a much higher performance and scalable 
      language.</P>
      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P><A 
      href="http://wolfram.com/products/mathematica/index.html">Mathematica</A> 
      is designed to be an easy-to-use tool for technical users such as 
      scientists and engineers. Consequently,              <A href="http://wolfram.com/">Wolfram 
      Research</A> (the creators of Mathematica) have put a great deal of effort 
      into creating a simple and powerful interface that makes Mathematica's 
      extensive capabilities as accessible as possible, even for 
      non-programmers.           </P>
      <P>In particular, Mathematica has a hugely productive integrated 
      development environment that allows programs to be defined hierarchically 
      (without the need for compilation units) and decorated with comments, 
      typeset mathematics and even interactive 2D and 3D visualizations:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Mathematica%20interoperability_files/mma2.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>This simple example elucidates several features of the Mathematica 
      environment:</P>
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI>Implicit code folding dictated by the hierarchical use of headings 
        and depicted graphically using thin cell handles on the right hand side 
        of the GUI.</LI>
        <LI>Use of typeset mathematics, both in comments describing the code and 
        in the code itself.</LI>
        <LI>Uniformity and brevity resulting from treating everything as an 
        expression, e.g. no need to wrap the subexpression                  
        <CODE>Sqrt[Tan[x]]</CODE> in an anonymous function with explicit free 
        variables before passing it to the                  
        <CODE>Integrate</CODE> function.               </LI>
        <LI>Evaluating a definition causes its result to be injected into the 
        notebook interface directly after the code segment.</LI>
        <LI>Symbolic results are automatically typeset and 3D graphical results 
        can be manipulated interactively with the mouse.</LI></OL>
      <P></P>
      <P>Although the F# programming language and IDE support have related 
      design goals, the F# language is designed to be used by programmers 
      primarily for the creation of applications. Consequently, F# has very 
      different characteristics to Mathematica and is much closer to 
      conventional .NET languages like C#. Hence the marriage of Mathematica 
      with F# greatly increases the utility of both languages.</P>
      <P>This articles examines the fundamental design and implementation of 
      Mathematica in order to provide the most natural and efficient 
      interoperability with F#. As we shall see, F# can be significantly more 
      efficient than Mathematica even when dealing with symbolic expressions but 
      Mathematica still provides an enormous breadth of functionality that 
      remains otherwise unavailable from F# and .NET.</P>
      <H2>Symbolic expressions in Mathematica</H2>
      <P>Previous F#.NET Journal articles have reviewed some of the 
      representations of symbolic expressions. Mathematica uses the following 
      slightly unconventional representation:</P>

      <P>Mathematica has the elegant design characteristic that everything is a 
      symbolic expression. So, in theory, we only need an F# representation of 
      such symbolic expressions in order to communicate between the two 
      languages.</P>
      <H2>Communicating symbolic expressions</H2>
      <P>As always, the F# programming language makes it easy to define a data 
      type representing the above definition of an expression:</P>
<PRE>&gt; #light;;
&gt; type expr =
    | Integer of int
    | String of string
    | Real of float
    | Symbol of string
    | Boolean of bool
    | Complex of complex
    | Function of string * expr array;;</PRE>
      <P>Compared to the previous definitions of symbolic expressions and 
      abstract syntax trees, this              <CODE>expr</CODE> type has an 
      obvious flaw: it cannot represent currying. This is usually represented as 
      the application of a functional value to an argument and then the 
      application of the functional result to another argument. However, the 
      Mathematica representation of a symbolic expression only allows the 
      function in an application to be specified as a string and not as an 
      arbitrary expression. Despite the emphasis upon functional techniques in 
      the literature about Mathematica, this is actually quite a serious and 
      fundamental design flaw.           </P>
      <P>Fortunately, the Mathematica Kernel can handle currying:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="margin-left: 50px;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Mathematica%20interoperability_files/currying.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>but, as we shall see, curried definitions cannot be communicated to and 
      from Mathematica.</P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>read</CODE> function reads a symbolic 
      expression from the given Kernel link, returning the F# representation of 
      a Mathematica expression as a value of the              <CODE>expr</CODE> 
      type:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec read (ml : IKernelLink) =
    match ml.GetExpressionType() with
    | ExpressionType.Integer -&gt; Integer(ml.GetInteger())
    | ExpressionType.String -&gt; String(ml.GetString())
    | ExpressionType.Real -&gt; Real(ml.GetDouble())
    | ExpressionType.Symbol -&gt; Symbol(ml.GetSymbol())
    | ExpressionType.Boolean -&gt; Boolean(ml.GetBoolean())
    | ExpressionType.Function -&gt;
        let args = ref 0
        let f = ml.GetFunction(args)
        Function(f, [|for i in 1 .. !args -&gt; read ml|])
    | _ -&gt; invalid_arg "Unsupported expression";;
val read : IKernelLink -&gt; expr</PRE>
      <P>Note how the              <CODE>GetFunction</CODE> member of the        
            <CODE>ml</CODE> object returns the functional value being applied as 
      a string rather than an expression.           </P>
      <P>Although .NET-Link provides a              <CODE>GetExpr</CODE> member 
      that can be used to fetch an entire expression it is not clear how this 
      expression might be deconstructed for manipulation from F# code. Indeed, 
      .NET-Link appears to be designed to bring the power of the .NET platform 
      to Mathematica but not the converse. Thus we have written our own 
      equivalent that builds a native F# data structure that is easily 
      manipulated from F#.           </P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>mma</CODE> function take a string 
      representation of a Mathematica expression, creates a new link to the 
      Mathematica Kernel, evaluates the expression in the kernel, reads and 
      returns the result as a value of the              <CODE>expr</CODE> type:  
               </P>
<PRE>&gt; let mma (expr : string) =
    let ml = MathLinkFactory.CreateKernelLink()
    try
      ml.WaitAndDiscardAnswer()
      ml.Evaluate(expr)
      ml.GetFunction(ref 0) |&gt; ignore
      read ml
    finally
      ml.Close();;
val mma : string -&gt; expr</PRE>
      <P>Note the use of the              <CODE>try..finally..</CODE> construct 
      to ensure that the kernel link is correctly closed upon completion. 
      Mathematica is effectively an unmanaged application because it is not 
      accurately garbage collected (like .NET). So it is always important to 
      remember to call such functions because they will manually deallocate 
      resources.           </P>
      <P>This functionality may be tested by evaluating various example 
      expressions that reduce to the basic kinds of expression handled by our 
      interface.</P>

      <P>The F# is already almost 9× faster than the original Mathematica but 
      several productive optimizations remain to be done. Firstly, common 
      subexpressions can be factored out to avoid recomputing expressions such 
      as              <CODE>tan x</CODE> . Secondly, F# currently does little to 
      optimize complex arithmetic so the arithmetic operations can be replaced 
      with the explicit calculations of real and imaginary parts to improve 
      performance even further.           </P>

      <P>Two obvious ways to improve this implementation are to avoid

      lines. These techniques will be described in future F#.NET Journal 
      articles, particularly the concept of              <I>functional 
      unparsing</I> that uses similar techniques to parser combinators in order 
      to pretty print grammars with precedence and associativity.           </P>
      <H2>Summary</H2>
      <P>This article has reviewed the basic concepts that underpin Mathematica 
      and used this knowledge to create a simple bridge between F# and 
      Mathematica. This bridge was used to demonstrate how Mathematica's 
      functionality can be combined with the performance of F# to get 
      complicated computational problems solved more quickly and easily than 
      with either language alone.</P>
      <P>Future F#.NET Journal articles will revisit several of the topics 
      covered in this article, including the manipulation of symbolic 
      expressions in F#, interoperability, visualization and even the creation 
      of a simple notebook interface for a new language using Windows 
      Presentation Foundation.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
