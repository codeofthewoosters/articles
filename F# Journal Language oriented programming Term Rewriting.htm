      <H1>Language oriented programming: Term Rewriting</H1>
      <P>An interesting and powerful alternative to the conventional term-level 
      interpreter is called term rewriting. Rather than reducing expressions 
      down to values, term rewriting simply evaluates expressions by performing 
      substitutions and the result of each substitution is another expression. 
      This approach is particularly well suited to computer algebra systems such 
      as Mathematica but is also an underappreciated alternative to 
      dynamically-typed programming languages that can integrate useful features 
      like pattern matching and make techniques like partial specialization far 
      easier. This article describes how a simple term rewriter can be 
      constructed in the F# programming language.</P>
      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P>The term-level interpreter described in a previous F#.NET Journal 
      article was centered around a core              <CODE>eval</CODE> function 
      that evaluates input expressions into output values with a signature 
      similar to the following:           </P>
<PRE>val eval : bindings -&gt; expr -&gt; value</PRE>
      <P>where              <CODE>bindings</CODE> refers to a mapping from the 
      name of each bound variable to its              <CODE>value</CODE> .       
          </P>
      <P>Term rewriting is closely related and centers around a core             
       <CODE>rewrite</CODE> combinator that substitutes subexpressions for other 
      expressions, with a signature similar to the following:           </P>
<PRE>val rewrite : (expr -&gt; expr) -&gt; expr -&gt; expr</PRE>
      <P>Note the following important features about this              
      <CODE>rewrite</CODE> combinator:           </P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>The                  <CODE>value</CODE> type is now considered to be 
        a special case of the                  <CODE>expr</CODE> type, e.g. 
        closures are now represented by expressions such as                  
        <CODE>Function[{x}, 2 x - 1]</CODE> in Mathematica.               </LI>
        <LI>Bindings that map symbols representing variables onto corresponding 
        values are now a special case of rewrite rules converting symbols into 
        expressions.</LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>The ability for rewriting to return (effectively unevaluated) 
      expressions is precisely what makes term rewriting useful for applications 
      like computer algebra. However, this idea is also closely related to 
      functional programming because expressions can act like the body of a 
      closure, allowing computations to be deferred and parameterized just like 
      a functional language. The primary disadvantage of term rewriting is that 
      it prohibits the sophisticated static type systems of languages like 
      Haskell, OCaml and F#. However, interactive technical computing is an 
      excellent example of an application domain where small programs are often 
      very useful and static typing can be correspondingly less valuable.</P>
      <P>This article describes some basic examples of term rewriting and, in 
      particular, its application in computer algebra before developing an 
      implementation of a very simple term-rewrite language.</P>
      <H2>Basic implementation and examples</H2>
      <P>The basic fixed-point              <CODE>rewrite</CODE> combinator 
      keeps rewriting subexpressions from the leaves up until the result stops 
      changing. Let us first consider this combinator in the context of the 
      following variant type:           </P>
<PRE># type expr =
    | Int of int
    | Symbol of string
    | Function of expr * expr list;;</PRE>
      <P>The              <CODE>rewrite</CODE> combinator may then be written:   
              </P>
<PRE># open List;;
# let rec rewrite rule expr =
    let expr' = match expr with
      | Function(h, t) -&gt; rule (Function(rewrite rule h, map (rewrite rule) t))
      | f -&gt; rule f in
    if expr=expr' then expr else rewrite rule expr';;
val rewrite : (expr -&gt; expr) -&gt; expr -&gt; expr = &lt;fun&gt;</PRE>
      <P>This function rewrites all subexpressions before rewriting the current 
      expression using the given rule. If rewriting alters the expression then 
      the result is rewritten again, until the result stops changing (i.e. fixed 
      point is reached).</P>
      <P>In the interests of clarity, let us define some operators to help us 
      build expressions:</P>
<PRE># let ( +: ) f g = Function(Symbol "Plus", [f; g]);;
val ( +: ) : expr -&gt; expr -&gt; expr = &lt;fun&gt;
# let ( *: ) f g = Function(Symbol "Times", [f; g]);;
val ( *: ) : expr -&gt; expr -&gt; expr = &lt;fun&gt;</PRE>
      <P>and a pretty printer:</P>
<PRE># open Format;;
# let prec = function
    | Int _ | Symbol _ -&gt; max_int
    | Function(Symbol "Plus", _) -&gt; 0
    | Function(Symbol "Times", _) -&gt; 1
    | Function _ -&gt; 2;;
val prec : expr -&gt; int = &lt;fun&gt;
# let rec print_expr ff = function
    | Int n -&gt; fprintf ff "%d" n
    | Symbol v -&gt; fprintf ff "%s" v
    | Function(Symbol "Plus", es) as f -&gt; print_exprs (prec f) " + " ff es
    | Function(Symbol "Times", es) as f -&gt; print_exprs (prec f) " " ff es
    | Function(h, t) -&gt;
        fprintf ff "%a[%a]" (print_exprs max_int "") [h] (print_exprs max_int ", ") t
  and print_exprs p sep ff = function
    | [] -&gt; fprintf ff ""
    | [f] when prec f &lt; p -&gt; fprintf ff "(%a)" print_expr f
    | [f] -&gt; fprintf ff "%a" print_expr f
    | f::fs when prec f &lt; p -&gt; fprintf ff "(%a)%s%a" print_expr f sep (print_exprs p sep) fs
    | f::fs -&gt; fprintf ff "%a%s%a" print_expr f sep (print_exprs p sep) fs;;
val print_expr : Format.formatter -&gt; expr -&gt; unit = &lt;fun&gt;
val print_exprs : int -&gt; string -&gt; Format.formatter -&gt; expr list -&gt; unit =
  &lt;fun&gt;
# #install_printer print_expr;;</PRE>
      <P>For example:</P>
<PRE># let x = Symbol "x" and a = Symbol "a" and b = Symbol "b" and c = Symbol "c";;
val x : expr = x
val a : expr = a
val b : expr = b
val c : expr = c
# let poly = a *: x *: x +: b *: x +: c;;
val poly : expr = a x x + b x + c</PRE>
      <P>This allows symbolic expressions to be pretty printed taking account of 
      operator precedence (but not associativity) when bracketing.</P>
      <H2>Expanding products</H2>
      <P>As a simple example, consider the following rule that expands out 
      products of additions:</P>
<PRE># let expand = function
    | Function(Symbol "Times", [f; Function(Symbol "Plus", [g; h])])
    | Function(Symbol "Times", [Function(Symbol "Plus", [g; h]); f]) -&gt;
        f *: g +: f *: h
    | f -&gt; f;;
val expand : expr -&gt; expr = &lt;fun&gt;</PRE>
      <P>We can use this              <CODE>expand</CODE> function in conjuction 
      with the              <CODE>rewrite</CODE> combinator to expand out some 
      non-trivial expressions:           </P>
<PRE># rewrite expand (poly *: poly);;
- : expr =
a x x a x x + a x x b x + a x x c + b x a x x + b x b x + b x c + c a x x + c b x + c c</PRE>
      <P>Repeated term rewriting has allowed this simple              
      <CODE>expand</CODE> rule to expand out a non-trivial product of two 
      quadratics giving the sum of the products of all pairs of terms from each 
      of the polynomials. This example elucidates the applicability of this 
      method to computer algebra.           </P>
      <H2>Improvements</H2>
      <P>The above implementation of term rewriting uses F#'s built-in 
      polymorphic equality to rewrite to fixed point. This has several 
      problems:</P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Quadratic complexity in the number of subexpressions because the 
        last application (that detects an unaltered expression) traverses the 
        entire expression and this is done at every node of the expression.</LI>
        <LI>Polymorphic equality detects structural equality and fails to take 
        into account the commutativity of the                  <CODE>Plus</CODE> 
        and                  <CODE>Times</CODE> operators.               </LI>
        <LI>Bad style because subsequent developments of the                  
        <CODE>expr</CODE> data structure (such as adding a lazily evaluated set 
        of the symbols used in each expression) might require a custom equality 
        function, rendering all existing applications of polymorphic equality to 
        the                  <CODE>expr</CODE> type incorrect without warning.   
                    </LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>We can use the following              <CODE>time</CODE> combinator to 
      benchmark the previous implementation and see how much we can improve upon 
      it:           </P>
<PRE># let time f x =
    let t = Sys.time() in
    let f_x = f x in
    printf "Took %fs\n%!" (Sys.time() -. t);
    f_x;;
val time : ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b = &lt;fun&gt;
# let e1 = time (rewrite expand) (poly *: poly *: poly *: poly *: poly *: poly *: poly);;
Took 6.316395s
...</PRE>
      <P>The improvements required to the previous design to make it more useful 
      boil down to being able to efficiently detect when no rewrites have 
      occured and handling the comparison of expressions more flexibly.</P>
      <H2>Detecting unaltered expressions</H2>
      <P>Physical (or              <I>reference</I> ) equality is ideal for the 
      detection of unaltered results. We simply add the requirement that rewrite 
      rules must return their input directly as their output whenever they do 
      nothing. This might sound trivial but, in fact, we have already violated 
      this within our              <CODE>rewrite</CODE> combinator:           
      </P>
<PRE>| Function(h, t) -&gt; rule (Function(rewrite rule h, map (rewrite rule) t))</PRE>
      <P>This line always constructs new output regardless of whether or not the 
      rewrites had any effect. Handling this with out new semantics requires 
      more care.</P>
      <P>We begin by writing a new variant of the existing higher-order          
          <CODE>map</CODE> function that is careful to return its input directly 
      whenever it is unaltered:           </P>
<PRE># let rec map_id f = function
    | [] -&gt; []
    | h::t as list -&gt;
        let h' = f h and t' = map_id f t in
        if h==h' &amp;&amp; t==t' then list else h'::t';;
val map_id : ('a -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'a list = &lt;fun&gt;</PRE>
      <P>Note how this function has a slightly different signature to the 
      conventional              <CODE>map</CODE> function because the argument 
      and return types must be the same in this case (which is not true of a 
      normal              <CODE>map</CODE> function).           </P>
      <P>Unlike the conventional              <CODE>map</CODE> function, this 
      function can now return physically identical results when the function     
               <CODE>f</CODE> returns physically identical results:           
      </P>
<PRE># let list = [1; 2; 3];;

# list == map (fun x -&gt; x) list;;

      <P>Working this              <CODE>map_id</CODE> function into our

- : bool = true</PRE>
      <P>In general, this implementation is asymptotically faster.</P>
      <H3>Encapsulating a better internal representation</H3>
      <P>Although we cannot prevent users from erroneously applying the built-in 
      polymorphic equality, comparison and hashing functions to our              
      <CODE>expr</CODE> type we can ensure that the type constructors are only 
      used to destructure expressions and not to construct them. Restricting the 
      construction of expressions allows us to ensure that they are constructed 
      according to our requirements and this, in turn, allows us to improve the 
      internal representation of expressions and ensure that expressions 
      violating our constraints cannot be constructed externally.           </P>
      <P>In this case, the commutativity of addition and multiplication 
      naturally lead us to a sorted representation for these two operators. 
      Moreover, we can right-rotate sums and products to ensure that these 
      operators appear to be left associative. This is best done by altering our 
      existing construction operators              <CODE>+:</CODE> and           
         <CODE>*:</CODE> . The constructors can be contained inside an           
         <CODE>Expr</CODE> module that only exposes the variant type as a 
      private type:           </P>

      module makes this type private outside the module. This restricts external 
      construction of expressions to only those functions exposed by the 
      interface of this module. These functions ensure that all terms and 
      factors in sums and products, respectively, are kept sorted according to 
      the total order provided by the              <CODE>Expr.compare</CODE> 
      function.  Note also how the              <CODE>func</CODE> function 
      automatically checks for the construction of sums and products, handling 
      the case that appears inside the              <CODE>rewrite</CODE> 
      function.           </P>
      <P>We can open this              <CODE>Expr</CODE> module and install its

      <P>This equivalent of our previous              <CODE>expand</CODE> rule

      when a product cannot be expanded, in order to return the expression 
      argument directly as the result rather than reconstructing it. This is

      <P>Using the              <CODE>rewrite</CODE> combinator to substitute

      <P>This illustrates how ordinary expression evaluation is a special case 
      of term rewriting. The expression need not reduce down to a simple value. 
      For example, we may wish to leave some variables unbound in order to 
      obtain a symbolic result:</P>

      <P>Note how the expressions are simpler but there is still room for more 
      simplification. Specifically, subexpressions of the form

      <H2>Summary</H2>
      <P>The term rewriter implemented in this article has already demonstrated 
      the fundamental properties of this approach to program interpretation. 
      Rewrite rules can be used to represent conventional reductions from 
      expressions down to primitive values and the ability to leave expressions 
      unevaluated facilitates functional features. In the process of developing 
      this simple implementation we have seen how private type constructors can 
      be used to contain errors and improve program reliability.</P>
      <P>Computer algebra systems are, of course, as complicated as you want to 
      make them. The most sophisticated commercial packages contain standard 
      libraries with tens of thousands of functions and their internals contain 
      many more. The previous example has actually highlighted an obvious 
      feature of this system that can be improved.</P>
      <P>Future F#.NET Journal articles will persue this line of thinking and 
      develop the simple term rewriter described here into a more sophisticated 
      approach to program interpretation including parsing new rewrite languages 
      that allow the built-in rules to be extended with new rules by the user. 
      This can benefit from a variety of generally-applicable techniques such as 
      parsing, hash consing, sophisticated data structures such as tries and 
      even the implementation of a pattern matcher.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
