      <H1>Objects and Augmentations in F#</H1>
      <P>In addition to functional programming, the F# language also offers 
      object-oriented programming (OOP) in harmony with the .NET platform. The 
      F# language takes powerful OOP concepts from C# and supplements them with 
      elegant functional constructs. The result combines the best aspects of 
      functional and object-oriented programming.</P>
      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P>Existing functional languages such as              <A href="http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/ocaml_for_scientists/">OCaml</A> 
      and              <A href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</A> have 
      demonstrated that concepts from functional programming allow many problems 
      to be solved more simply and elegantly than with more common programming 
      paradigms like object-oriented programming. Thanks to its heritage, F# 
      programmers can leverage functional programming and never need to worry 
      about the object-oriented intermediate representation used by .NET.        
         </P>
      <P>However, interoperability is one of the key benefits of the F# 
      programming language and, in order to interoperate with object-oriented 
      languages like C#, it is necessary to be able to manipulate and even 
      create objects in F# programs.</P>
      <P>This article gives a brief overview of object-oriented programming 
      before describing some of the advantages that objects provide in the 
      context of F# and how these advantages can be exploited by augmenting F# 
      types with object-oriented constructs.</P>
      <H2>Object-oriented programming</H2>
      <P>Classes are a core concept in object-oriented programming. A class is a 
      type of object. Class definitions describe the interface that an object of 
      that class must present to the outside world. In order to present these 
      interfaces, objects encapsulate all manner of definitions, functions 
      (members), values (properties) and even types (nested classes).</P>
      <P>Moreover, the relationships between classes may be described by 
      inheritance relationships. A derived class is expected to provide all of 
      the features of its parent and possibly more.</P>
      <P>For example, an F# record type representing a two-dimensional vector 
      with mutable components may be written:</P>
<PRE>&gt; type Vec2 = {mutable x: float; mutable y: float};;</PRE>
      <P>This native F# type is equivalent to a C# class that implements two 
      properties called              <CODE>X</CODE> and              
      <CODE>Y</CODE> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; type Vec2(a : float, b : float) = class
    let mutable x = a
    let mutable y = b</PRE>
<PRE>    member r.X
      with get() = x
      and set(v) = x &lt;- v</PRE>
<PRE>    member r.Y
      with get() = y
      and set(v) = y &lt;- v
  end;;</PRE>
      <P>Although the definition of the class is longer than the definition of 
      the record, the class-based approach opens up the getting and setting of 
      the properties              <CODE>X</CODE> and              <CODE>Y</CODE> 
      such that we could insert computations to be performed when the properties 
      are retreived or adjusted. Indeed, the representation of a property value 
      inside a class might be replaced, e.g. to use a polar internal 
      representation.           </P>
      <P>Note that, unlike C#, this F# class definition has an implicit 
      constructor. Class constructors may also be written explicitly in F#, 
      although this is typically less desirable:</P>
<PRE>&gt; type Vec2 = class
    val mutable x : float
    val mutable y : float</PRE>
<PRE>    new(a, b) = {x=a; y=b}</PRE>
<PRE>    member r.X
      with get() = r.x
      and set(v) = r.x &lt;- v</PRE>
<PRE>    member r.Y
      with get() = r.y
      and set(v) = r.y &lt;- v
  end;;</PRE>
      <P>Another interesting difference is that the              
      <CODE>new</CODE>  keyword found in most mainstream object-oriented 
      programming languages (C++, C# and Java) is redundant in F# for 
      user-defined classes and may be omitted:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; Vec2(3., 4.);;
val it : Vec2 = ...</PRE>
      <P>This article describes some of the interesting ways that classes may be 
      augmented with useful constructs in F#.</P>
      <H2>Augmentations</H2>
      <P>We may wish to add a              <CODE>Length</CODE> member function 
      to our              <CODE>Vec2</CODE> class. This can be achieved using a 
      C# style:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; type Vec2(a : float, b : float) = class
    let mutable x = a
    let mutable y = b</PRE>
<PRE>    member r.X
      with get() = x
      and set(v) = x &lt;- v</PRE>
<PRE>    member r.Y
      with get() = y
      and set(v) = y &lt;- v</PRE>
<PRE>    member r.Length() = sqrt(r.X*r.X + r.Y*r.Y)
  end;;</PRE>
      <P>Note that the definition of the              <CODE>Length</CODE> member 
      function is careful to use the abstractions (the              
      <CODE>X</CODE> and              <CODE>Y</CODE> properties) rather than 
      dissecting the internal representation itself (the              
      <CODE>x</CODE> and              <CODE>y</CODE> variables), as this reduces 
      the number of code changes required when the internal representation of 
      the properties is altered.           </P>
      <P>Alternatively, the              <CODE>Length</CODE> member function may 
      be added to the much more succinct F# record definition, as an 
      augmentation:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; type Vec2 = {mutable x: float; mutable y: float} with
    member r.Length() = sqrt(r.x*r.x + r.y*r.y)
  end;;</PRE>
      <P>This demonstrates how simply and easily the native-F# types may be 
      extended as if they were classes.</P>
      <P>Augmenting a native F# type with member functions is typically 
      undesirable because the conventional function style (separating the 
      functions from the types they act upon) is easier:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let length r = sqrt(r.x*r.x + r.y*r.y);;
val length : Vec2 -&gt; float</PRE>
      <P>However, the .NET platform provides more interesting forms of 
      augmentation that cannot be written in the conventional functional 
      style.</P>
      <H3>Getters and setters</H3>
      <P>The getters and setters of a property are the simplest useful 
      augmentation. In the case of our              <CODE>Vec2</CODE> type, we 
      could allow the vector length to be both written and read. This can be 
      accomplished by implementing              <CODE>Length</CODE> as a 
      property, rather than a member function, and providing a getter and a 
      setter for the              <CODE>Length</CODE> property:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; type Vec2 = {mutable x: float; mutable y: float} with
    member r.Length
      with get() = sqrt(r.x*r.x + r.y*r.y)
      and set(s) =
        let s = s / r.Length
	r.x &lt;- s * r.x
	r.y &lt;- s * r.y
  end;;</PRE>
      <P>For example, the vector              <I>(3, 4)</I> may be scaled to 
      unit length:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let r = Vec2(3., 4.);;
val r : Vec2
&gt; r.Length &lt;- 1.;;
&gt; r.x, r.y;;
val it : float * float = (0.6, 0.8)</PRE>
      <P>Getters and setters provide a powerful method of abstraction, useful in 
      a variety of circumstances. Most notably, getters and setters are an 
      excellent way to provide a clear and simple interface to GUI objects. As 
      we shall see, GUI programming is one of the pedagogical examples for 
      object-oriented design.</P>
      <H3>Indexing</H3>
      <P>Many data structures are indexed. Arrays map integers indexes onto 
      array elements. Hash tables are indexed by arbitrary key values. One can 
      imagine several other data structures where indexing can be useful.</P>
      <P>Data structures are indexed in F# using the notation:</P>
<PRE>&gt; a.[i];;</PRE>
      <P>This notation for indexing may be overloaded for a new class definition 
      by implementing a property called              <CODE>Item</CODE> .         
        </P>
      <P>We have already met the binary tree data structure:</P>
<PRE>&gt; type 'a t =
    | Empty
    | Node of 'a t * 'a * 'a t;;</PRE>
      <P>Consider a binary tree used to represent an arbitrary sequence with 
      indexing of each element by an integer. This may be implemented by 
      supplementing each node with the number of elements it contains and 
      searching the tree in the getter of the              <CODE>Item</CODE> 
      property:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; type 'a t =
    | Empty
    | Node of 'a t * 'a * 'a t * int with</PRE>
<PRE>    member r.Item
      with get i =
        match i, r with
        | _, Empty -&gt; raise Not_found
        | 0, Node(Empty, v, _, _) -&gt; v
        | i, Node(Empty, _, r, _) -&gt; r.[i - 1]
        | i, Node(Node(_, _, _, j) as l, v, r, _) -&gt;
            if j &gt; i then l.[i] else
              if j = i then v else
                r.[i - j - 1]
  end;;</PRE>
      <P>The              <CODE>Item</CODE> property must reside in the type 
      definition (object-oriented style) but the related definitions that make 
      this type useful may be written in the functional style. The values used 
      to construct an immutable sequence may be written:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let empty = Empty;;
val empty : 'a t
&gt; let node = Node(l, v, r, size l + 1 + size r);;
val node : ('a t * 'a * 'a t) -&gt; 'a t</PRE>
      <P>Functions to insert elements at the front or back of a sequence:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let prepend first back = node(Empty, first, back);;
val prepend : 'a * 'a t -&gt; 'a t
&gt; let append front last = node(front, last, Empty);;
val prepend : 'a t * 'a -&gt; 'a t</PRE>
      <P>A function to convert an IEnumerable into our immutable sequence 
      type:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let of_seq seq = Seq.fold append Empty seq;;
val of_seq : #seq&lt;'a&gt; -&gt; 'a t</PRE>
      <P>and so on. We shall return to this example in a future article, as 
      immutable sequences can be very useful in the context of purely functional 
      programming.</P>
      <H3>Operator Overloading</H3>
      <P>The final form of augmentation, but by no means the least important, is 
      operator overloading. The F# programming language is unusual in that it 
      combines the type inference of              <A href="http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/ocaml_for_scientists/">OCaml</A> 
      with the operator overloading of C++ and C#. Reconciling these methods is 
      not easy because operator overloading makes type inference ambiguous. 
      Consequently, F# programs may require type annotations.           </P>
      <P>For example, a function to square a number acquires the default type 
      for the              <CODE>*</CODE> operator of              
      <CODE>int</CODE> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let sqr x = x * x;;
val sqr : int -&gt; int</PRE>
      <P>The default may be overridden by annotating the type of the argument    
                <CODE>x</CODE> to the function              <CODE>sqr</CODE> to 
      be a              <CODE>float</CODE> . The F# compiler then infers the use 
      of floating point multiplication rather than integer multiplication:       
          </P>
<PRE>&gt; let sqr (x : float) = x * x;;
val sqr : float -&gt; float</PRE>
      <P>Existing operators (such as              <CODE>+</CODE> and             
       <CODE>*</CODE> ) may be overloaded to work on user-defined types by 
      augmenting the type definition with static member functions called         
           <CODE>( + )</CODE> and              <CODE>( * )</CODE> that accept a 
      pair of arguments (rather than being curried).           </P>
      <P>Consider a variant that might be used to represent symbolic 
      expressions:</P>
<PRE>&gt; type expr =
    | Int of int
    | Var of string
    | Add of expr * expr
    | Mul of expr * expr;;</PRE>
      <P>Constructing symbolic expressions requires a rather laborious use of 
      prefix notation. For example, the expression              <I>a x           
          <SUP>2</SUP> + b x + c             </I> may be constructed with:       
          </P>
<PRE>&gt; let x, a, b, c = Var "x", Var "a", Var "b", Var "c";;
val x : expr
val a : expr
val b : expr
val c : expr
&gt; let expr = Add(Add(Mul(Mul(a, x), x), Mul(b, x)), c);;
val expr : expr</PRE>
      <P>Needless to say, this approach to constructing symbolic expressions is 
      rather tedious.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, this can be addressed by augmenting the              
      <CODE>expr</CODE> type with definitions for overloaded operators           
         <CODE>+</CODE> and              <CODE>*</CODE> that make it easier to 
      construct values of the type              <CODE>expr</CODE> :           
      </P>
<PRE>&gt; type expr =
    | Int of int
    | Var of string
    | Add of expr * expr
    | Mul of expr * expr with</PRE>
<PRE>    static member ( + ) (f, g) = Add(f, g)
    static member ( * ) (f, g) = Mul(f, g)
  end</PRE>
      <P>Note the spaces in              <CODE>( * )</CODE> to disambiguate it 
      from the start of an F# comment.           </P>
      <P>Our example expression may now be constructed more elegantly:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let e = a * x * x + b * x + c;;
val e : expr</PRE>
      <P>Similarly, functions that act upon symbolic expressions may be written 
      more elegantly using these overloaded operators. For example, the 
      following function computes the derivative of a symbolic expression        
            <CODE>e</CODE> with respect to a variable name              
      <CODE>x</CODE> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec d e x =
    match e with
    | Int _ -&gt; Int 0
    | Add(f, g) -&gt; d f x + d g x
    | Mul(f, g) -&gt; f * d g x + g * d f x
    | Var v -&gt; Int (if v=x then 1 else 0);;
val d : expr -&gt; string -&gt; expr</PRE>
      <P>As an interesting finale, let us compute the symbolic derivative of our 
      example expression:</P>
<PRE>&gt; d e "x";;
val it : expr =
  Add
   (Add
     (Add (Mul (Mul (Var "a", Var "x"), Int 1),
       Mul (Var "x", Add (Mul (Var "a", Int 1), Mul (Var "x", Int 0)))),
     Add (Mul (Var "b", Int 1), Mul (Var "x", Int 0))),
   Int 0)</PRE>
      <P>This result would clearly benefit from some simplification. We shall 
      return to the topic of symbolic manipulation in later articles in the 
      context of interpreters, computer algebra systems and metaprogramming. 
      Suffice to say that simplifying reduction rules may be inserted into the 
      overloaded              <CODE>+</CODE> and              <CODE>*</CODE> 
      operators, to simplify expressions as they are constructed.           </P>
      <H2>Expressiveness</H2>
      <P>Before concluding this article, let us highlight the main theoretical 
      difference that underpins the different forms of expressiveness exhibited 
      by the functional and object-oriented programming styles.</P>
      <P>Object-oriented programming is all about encapsulating related type and 
      function definitions in classes. Consequently, this approach is most 
      suitable when objects are used to represent entities that encapsulate 
      well. For example, the functionality provided by a GUI control is 
      well-defined during design and the functions required for a given control 
      are limited in number and unambiguous to define.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the functional style takes the transpose view of the same 
      situation. Types and functions are separated and inheritance relationships 
      are flattened into single sum types. This approach is preferable when the 
      extent of a type is well-defined by design but the number of functions 
      that act upon the type is unlimited. For example, a binary tree is known 
      to have only branches and leaves, the contents of which are well-defined, 
      but the number of functions acting on binary trees is unlimited.</P>
      <P>So the essential difference between object-oriented and functional 
      programming is that the former makes it easier to create new types whereas 
      the latter makes it easier to create new 
functions.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
