      <H1>Balanced Binary Search Trees</H1>
      <P>Functional programming languages like F# excel at handling immutable 
      data structures. In the interests of efficiency, such  data structures are 
      typically based upon trees rather than hash tables. Key benefits include 
      the ability to express algorithms elegantly using a declarative style and 
      the inherent thread safety of immutable data structures makes them ideal 
      for concurrent programming. This article describes the design and 
      implementation of a basic balanced binary search tree data structure 
      similar to that of the built-in              <CODE>Set</CODE> module.      
           </P>
      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P>Previous articles have explained why tree data structures are a core 
      concept in functional programming languages like F#. Up to now, the 
      examples given were all concrete data structures that reflected an 
      abstract form of information, such as the use of abstract syntax trees to 
      represent symbolic mathematical expressions and even programs. However, 
      naive use of tree data structures can easily lead to the inefficiency of a 
      simple list when trees become highly asymmetric. Specifically, allowing a 
      tree to grow unbounded in a single direction (e.g. to the left) yields the 
      inefficiencies of the list data structure, where all existing elements 
      must be traversed before the last element can be reached, i.e. O(n) 
      search. This inefficiency can be improved upon enormously without 
      sacrificing the immutability the container by simply balancing the tree as 
      it is created. A balanced tree provides O(log n) search.</P>
      <H2>Monomorphic binary search tree type</H2>
      <P>A binary search tree containing integers may be defined as:</P>
<PRE>&gt; type t =
    | Empty
    | Node of t * int * t;;
type t =
  | Empty
  | Node of t * int * t</PRE>
      <P>The type constructor              <CODE>Empty</CODE> represents an 
      empty search tree. Elements in a search tree are stored using the          
          <CODE>Node</CODE> type constructor. In the interests of efficiency, 
      child trees are always stored in order, so the elements in a left branch 
      are always less than the central element which is always less than the 
      elements of the right branch.           </P>
      <P>For example, the following value is a valid binary search tree:</P>
<PRE>&gt; Node(Node(Empty, 3, Empty), 4, Empty);;
val it : t = Node(Node(Empty, 3, Empty), 4, Empty)</PRE>
      <P>However, this type of search tree is of limited practical utility 
      because it can only store elements of the type              
      <CODE>int</CODE> . A tree that is generic over the type of elements that 
      it stores is much more useful in practice.           </P>
      <H2>Polymorphic binary tree</H2>
      <P>A polymorphic binary search tree may be defined by preceding the type   
                 <CODE>t</CODE> with a type variable              
      <CODE>'a</CODE> and referring to the type of an element within this type 
      definition as              <CODE>'a</CODE> rather than              
      <CODE>int</CODE> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; type 'a t =
    | Empty
    | Node of 'a t * 'a * 'a t;;
type 'a t =
  | Empty
  | Node of 'a t * 'a * 'a t</PRE>
      <P>The previous example remains valid:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let example = Node(Node(Empty, 3, Empty), 4, Empty);;
val example : int t</PRE>
      <P>However, note how the type of the tree is now              <CODE>int 
      t</CODE> rather than just              <CODE>t</CODE> .           </P>
      <H2>Folding over a tree</H2>
      <P>We have already encountered the ubiquitous fold functions used to 
      replace loops over containers in functional programming languages. A 
      binary search tree might have two different fold functions for folding 
      over the elements in forward and reverse order. The following              
      <CODE>fold</CODE>  function implements a left fold by folding over the 
      elements to the left before folding over those to the right:           
</P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec fold f accu = function
    | Empty -&gt; accu
    | Node(l, v, r) -&gt; fold f (f (fold f accu l) v) r;;
val fold : ('a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b t -&gt; 'a</PRE>
      <P>For example, folding over our example search tree lists the integers in 
      the container in order, with 3 appearing before 4 because it is in the 
      left branch:</P>
<PRE>&gt; fold (fun () n -&gt; print_int n) () example;;
34</PRE>
      <P>In F#, folding is the easiest way to accumulate a result from all of 
      the elements in a container, e.g. to sum all of the elements. As we shall 
      see, the ability to search for an individual element (i.e. test for set 
      membership) is of particular interest in the context of balanced binary 
      search trees as this operation can be performed asymptotically more 
      quickly than with lists.</P>
      <H2>Inserting elements without balancing</H2>
      <P>A new element              <CODE>x</CODE> may be inserted into a tree 
      using a function              <CODE>add</CODE> that pattern matches over 
      the tree:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec add x = function
    | Empty -&gt; Node(Empty, x, Empty)
    | Node(l, v, r) -&gt;
        match compare x v with
        | c when c&lt;0 -&gt; Node(add x l, v, r)
        | c when c&gt;0 -&gt; Node(l, v, add x r)
        | _ -&gt; Node(l, x, r);;
val add : 'a -&gt; 'a t -&gt; 'a t</PRE>
      <P>Note that we are careful to use a single call to the built-in 
      polymorphic comparison function              <CODE>compare</CODE> , that 
      provides a total order over values of any type by returning -1, 0 or 1 for 
      less than, equal to or greater than respectively. This is more efficient 
      than calling the polymorphic comparison functions              
      <CODE>&lt;</CODE> and              <CODE>&gt;</CODE> on the element type 
      because they might require arbitrary computation rather than the ensuing 
      integer comparisons used here.           </P>
      <P>Inserting the element              <CODE>5</CODE> into our example tree 
      results in the new piece of tree being introduced on the right-hand side 
      of the root:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; add 5 example
val it : int t = Node (Node (Empty,3,Empty),4,Node (Empty,5,Empty))</PRE>
      <P>Note that this leaves              <CODE>example</CODE> unaltered 
      because this is an immutable (purely functional) data structure.           
      </P>
      <P>Adding a sorted sequence of elements leads to the worst-case behaviour 
      of a highly unbalanced tree:</P>
<PRE>&gt; List.fold_right add [1 .. 10] Empty
val it : int t
= Node
   (Node
     (Node
       (Node
         (Node
           (Node
             (Node
               (Node (Node (Node (Empty,1,Empty),2,Empty),3,Empty),4,Empty),5,
              Empty),6,Empty),7,Empty),8,Empty),9,Empty),10,Empty)</PRE>
      <P>In this case, searching for the element              <CODE>10</CODE> 
      would require us to traverse all other elements, performing 10 
      comparisons. This inefficiency can be addressed by creating only balanced 
      trees.           </P>
      <H2>Inserting elements with balancing</H2>
      <P>The              <CODE>add</CODE> function introduced in the previous 
      section needs minimal alterations to use another function to balance trees 
      as they are constructed.           </P>
      <P>There are various different approaches to maintaining balancing. In 
      this article, we shall consider height-balanced trees that ensure that 
      child nodes remain within a fixed height difference of each other. 
      Rebalancing is performed by rotating the tree, moving elements from the 
      left to the right or vice-versa.</P>
      <P>The process of keeping height-balanced trees balanced as nodes are 
      inserted and removed makes heavy use of the height of a tree and, 
      consequently, the height is typically stored in each node. The type 
      definition then becomes:</P>
<PRE>&gt; type 'a t =
    | Empty
    | Node of 'a t * 'a * 'a t * int
type 'a t =
  | Empty
  | Node of 'a t * 'a * 'a t * int</PRE>
      <P>where the extra              <CODE>int</CODE> argument to the           
         <CODE>Node</CODE> type constructor stores the height.           </P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>height</CODE> function can be used to 
      find the height of a given tree:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec height = function
    | Empty -&gt; 0
    | Node(_, _, _, h) -&gt; h;;
val height : 'a t -&gt; int</PRE>
      <P>The              <CODE>Node</CODE> constructor can be replaced by a     
               <CODE>node</CODE> function that augments the contents of a node 
      with its height metadata:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let node(l, v, r) =
    Node(l, v, r, 1 + max (height l) (height r));;
val node : 'a t * 'a * 'a t -&gt; 'a t</PRE>
      <P>The following              <CODE>bal</CODE> function performs a single 
      local rotation of the tree in order to keep it balanced when a single node 
      has been added or removed:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec bal(l, v, r) =
    let hl, hr = height l, height r
    match l, v, r with
    | Node(ll, lv, lr, _), v, r when hl &gt; hr+1 -&gt;
        let hll, hlr = height ll, height lr
        match lr with
        | Node(lrl, lrv, lrr, _) when hll &lt; hlr -&gt;
            node(node(ll, lv, lrl), lrv, node(lrr, v, r))
        | lr -&gt; node(ll, lv, node(lr, v, r))
    | l, v, Node(rl, rv, rr, _) when hl+1 &lt; hr -&gt;
        let hrl, hrr = height rl, height rr
        match rl with
        | Node(rll, rlv, rlr, _) when hrl &gt; hrr -&gt;
            node(node(l, v, rll), rlv, node(rlr, rv, rr))
        | rl -&gt; node(node(l, v, rl), rv, rr)
    | l, v, r -&gt; node(l, v, r);;
val bal : 'a t * 'a * 'a t -&gt; 'a t</PRE>
      <P>The previous implementation of the              <CODE>add</CODE> 
      function needs minimal alterations to handle balanced trees. Specifically, 
      the              <CODE>bal</CODE> function is used to construct nodes when 
      the structure of the tree might have changed and the              
      <CODE>node</CODE> function is used otherwise:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec add x = function
    | Empty -&gt; node(Empty, x, Empty)
    | Node(l, v, r, _) -&gt;
        match compare x v with
        | c when c&lt;0 -&gt; bal(add x l, v, r)
        | c when c&gt;0 -&gt; bal(l, v, add x r)
        | _ -&gt; node(l, x, r);;
val add : 'a -&gt; 'a t -&gt; 'a t</PRE>
      <P>These functions capture the essence of balanced binary tree 
      implementations and form an exquisite example of just how beautiful F# 
      code can be. The origin of the efficiency of all balanced binary tree 
      functions lies in their use of recursive subdivision to roughly halve the 
      problem space at each step (because the left and right branches are 
      roughly the same size).</P>
      <H2>Finding and removing elements</H2>
      <P>Functions for finding and removing elements are also easy to write in 
      F#. The following              <CODE>mem</CODE> function searches a 
      balanced tree recursively, looking for the given element:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec mem x = function
    | Empty -&gt; false
    | Node(l, v, r, _) -&gt;
        match compare x v with
        | c when c&lt;0 -&gt; mem x l
        | c when c&lt;0 -&gt; mem x r
        | _ -&gt; x=v;;
val mem : 'a -&gt; 'a t -&gt; bool</PRE>
      <P>Removing elements from the tree is slightly more involved. When the 
      element in a node is removed, the left and right branches of the node must 
      be joined. This is most easily performed by introducing functions that 
      remove the first or last nodes from a tree.</P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>split_left</CODE> function simply 
      recurses into the left branch and accumulates the left-most element and 
      remaining tree:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec split_left = function
      | Empty -&gt; raise Not_found
      | Node(Empty, x, r, _) -&gt; x, r
      | Node(l, v, r, _) as t -&gt;
          let x, l = split_left l
          x, bal(l, v, r);;
val split_left : 'a t -&gt; 'a * 'a t</PRE>
      <P>This is a special case of removing the first element.</P>
      <P>A function to merge left and right subtrees can then use this           
         <CODE>split_left</CODE> function to take a central element from the 
      right branch:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let merge l = function
    | Empty -&gt; l
    | r -&gt;
        let v, r = split_left r
        bal(l, v, r);;
val merge : 'a t -&gt; 'a t -&gt; 'a t</PRE>
      <P>Note that we are careful to handle the case of an empty right tree 
      explicitly in the              <CODE>merge</CODE> function using a pattern 
      match rather than handling the exception thrown by the              
      <CODE>split_left</CODE> function. Exceptions are heavyweight on the .NET 
      platform and, consequently, should be avoided in code that might be 
      performance critical, such as this generic tree implementation.           
      </P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>remove</CODE> function searches a 
      balanced tree recursively and removes the given element, raising the       
             <CODE>Not_found</CODE> exception if the element is not found in the 
      tree:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec remove x = function
      | Empty -&gt; raise Not_found
      | Node(l, v, r, _) -&gt;
          match compare x v with
          | c when c&lt;0 -&gt; bal(remove x l, v, r)
          | c when c&gt;0 -&gt; bal(l, v, remove x r)
          | _ -&gt; merge l r;;
val remove : 'a -&gt; 'a t -&gt; 'a t</PRE>
      <P>This function required more sophistication than the              
      <CODE>add</CODE> function but the F# code required to implement this 
      functionality is remarkably small. This completes a simple set 
      implementation that allows elements to be added, removed and found in a 
      set efficiently (all in logarithmic time).           </P>
      <H2>Testing</H2>
      <P>The wonderfully expressive static type system provided by F# means that 
      most of the bugs in the above code are found by the F# compiler at compile 
      time. These bugs are easily eliminated and, once the implementation 
      compiles without error, the need for huge amounts of unit testing at 
      microscopic scales is obviated. The few remaining bugs still warrant the 
      use of unit tests but now only at a macroscopic level, i.e. testing the 
      whole balanced binary tree module.</P>
      <P>All of the above code can be tested by simply choosing random numbers, 
      testing for membership in the set, inserting and recording new numbers in 
      a list and then trying to remove the recorded numbers from the set to 
      obtain the empty set. Additionally, the balancing criteria of the tree 
      (that subtrees differ in depth by at most one) can be tested at every 
      intermediate step.</P>
      <P>The maximum difference in height of all subtrees in a tree may be found 
      with:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec check = function
    | Empty -&gt; 0
    | Node(l, _, r, _) -&gt;
        max(max(abs(height l - height r)) (check l)) (check r);;
val check : 'a t -&gt; int</PRE>
      <P>The following function inserts a random number into a set and (if the 
      number was not already present in the set) a list:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let aux (list, set) _ =
    let n = rand.Next()
    let set' = add n set
    if mem n set then list, set' else
    let d = check set'
    if d &gt; 1 then print_any d
    n::list, set';;
val aux : int list * int t -&gt; 'a -&gt; int list * int t</PRE>
      <P>The following function removes the given element from the set:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let aux2 set x =
    if not(mem x set) then printf "Not here!"
    let set = remove x set
    let d = check set
    if d &gt; 1 then print_any d
    set;;
val aux2 : 'a t -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a t</PRE>
      <P>A pair of folds can be used to generate a large set and remove its 
      elements, leaving only the empty set:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let list, set = Seq.fold aux ([], empty) {1 .. 10000}
  Seq.fold aux2 set list;;
val it : int t = Empty</PRE>
      <P>This test indicates that the balancing and searching of this tree 
      implementation work correctly.</P>
      <H2>Further work</H2>
      <P>When considering ways to make this balanced binary tree implementation 
      more generic, the possibilities are endless. Here are some ideas for the 
      keen reader:</P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Add a                  <CODE>split</CODE> function to split a tree 
        into trees containing subranges               </LI>
        <LI>Add another type constructor to represent subtrees that have not yet 
        been rebalanced. Searching should force rebalancing but operations like 
        folds do not need to rebalance.</LI>
        <LI>Replace searching by value for set-theoretic operations with 
        searching by index for array-like operations.</LI>
        <LI>Augment the definition of the tree type with an                  
        <CODE>Item</CODE> property to allow easy indexing into the tree.         
              </LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <H2>Summary</H2>
      <P>As this example has shown, the combination of variant types and pattern 
      matching make it extremely easy to implement high-performance tree-based 
      algorithms based upon purely functional (immutable) data structures.</P>
      <P>As data structures and algorithms are core subjects in computer 
      science, unrelated to the particular merits of the F# language, this is 
      the ideal opportunity to mine the wealth of information and even 
      implementations already accumulated for the OCaml programming language. In 
      particular, we recommend the following excellent OCaml data 
structures:</P>

      <P>For a detailed discussion of the theoretical characteristics and design 
      of purely functional data structures, read Chris Okasaki's excellent PhD 
      thesis and book              <A href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf">Purely 
      Functional Data Structures</A> .           </P>
      <P>For a thorough description of algorithmic complexity in the context of 
      data structures and the design and implementation of data structures for 
      numerical computing, read              <A href="http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/ocaml_for_scientists/">OCaml

      <P>Future F#.NET Journal articles will cover more exotic purely functional 
      data structures in detail as well as many adaptations of the balanced 
      binary search tree introduced in this article. In particular, the example 
      of balanced trees will also be used to illustrate extensible programming 
      styles, code reuse and a variety of sophisticated algorithms including 
      multiresolution representations for graphics.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
