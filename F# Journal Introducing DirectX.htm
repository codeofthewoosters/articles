      <H1>Introducing DirectX</H1>
      <P>The .NET platform contains library interfaces to almost all of the 
      functionality bundled with the Windows platform. Hardware-accelerated 
      graphics are no exception and Managed DirectX (             <B>MDX</B> ) 
      for .NET provides a high-level and type-safe interface to the DirectX API. 
                </P>
      <H2>Overview</H2>
      <P>A basic DirectX renderer creates a Windows form and places a single 
      control in it called a DirectX device.</P>
      <P>DirectX devices encapsulate the canvas, parameters (e.g. whether or not 
      a depth-buffer and multi-sampling are provided) and texture and geometry 
      data.</P>
      <P>The              <CODE>Paint</CODE> event of the form containing the 
      DirectX device will ensure that the device is correctly configured before 
      conveying rendering information to DirectX using function calls and .NET 
      data structures (primarily arrays). Once the transfer of information is 
      complete, the result is              <I>presented</I> on the canvas.       
          </P>
      <P>The way the results are presented (rendered) is determined by the       
             <I>present parameters</I> that were given to the DirectX device. 
      DirectX (including MDX) is unusually low-level and it exposes invalidation 
      of the current device (e.g. when the window is enlarged and the canvas is 
      no longer large enough to cover it) via device              <I>resets</I> 
      and              <I>losses</I> that must be handled by all programs that 
      use DirectX.           </P>
      <P>Once the information required for rendering has been conveyed to 
      DirectX via a series of calls, the              <CODE>Present</CODE> 
      member of the DirectX device is called to display the result.           
      </P>
      <P>The creation of a form and device, and the handling of events can be 
      achieved in two different ways in F#. The C#-style approach of deriving a 
      new class from a Windows form that encapsulated the DirectX device that it 
      uses and overrides the necessary events is currently considered idiomatic 
      for the .NET platform. However, the F# language also allows us to use 
      first class events, add handlers to existing classes and use a different 
      approach to encapsulation. In this article, we shall use the latter 
      approach, which is idiomatic F# and leads to flatter, clearer and shorter 
      programs. As we shall see, the ability to factor out higher-order 
      functions is of critical importance with this approach.</P>
      <H2>References</H2>
      <P>In order to use MDX, an F# program must begin with references to the 
      appropriate DLLs. The              <CODE>#I</CODE> directive instructs F# 
      to add the given directory to its search path:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; #I @"C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\DirectX for Managed Code\1.0.2902.0";;</PRE>
      <P>In this case, we are searching for the latest release of MDX at the 
      time of writing.</P>
      <P>Now we can refer to the three relevant DLLs:</P>
<PRE>&gt; #r "Microsoft.DirectX.dll";;
&gt; #r "Microsoft.DirectX.Direct3D.dll";;
&gt; #r "Microsoft.DirectX.Direct3DX.dll";;</PRE>
      <P>The first two provide core DirectX functionality and the last one adds 
      some useful utility functions.</P>
      <P>When compiling to a standalone executable rather than running 
      interactively, there can also be a requirement for the              
      <CODE>Microsoft.VisualC.dll</CODE> . This is most easily added via the     
               <CODE>Project</CODE> dialog.           </P>
      <H2>Namespaces</H2>
      <P>Programs that use DirectX typically make us of a variety of definitions 
      from various namespaces, so it is useful to open the most common ones:</P>
<PRE>&gt; open System;;
&gt; open Drawing;;
&gt; open Windows.Forms;;
&gt; open Microsoft.DirectX;;
&gt; open Direct3D;;</PRE>
      <H2>Present parameters</H2>
      <P>The properties of a DirectX device are encapsulated in a class called   
                 <CODE>PresentParameters</CODE> that must be created and 
      initialized appropriately such that it can be passed to the device upon 
      creation and when the device is reset.           </P>
      <P>A simple              <CODE>PresentParameters</CODE> may be created as 
      follows:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let present_params =
    let p = new PresentParameters()
    p.Windowed &lt;- true
    p.SwapEffect &lt;- SwapEffect.Discard
    p.EnableAutoDepthStencil &lt;- true
    p.AutoDepthStencilFormat &lt;- DepthFormat.D24S8
    [|p|];;
val present_params : PresentParameters array</PRE>
      <P>The              <CODE>PresentParameters</CODE> class is an object 
      oriented representation of the optional arguments that can be passed to a 
      DirectX device. This design pattern is typical of object oriented 
      languages and is seen throughout .NET. In particular, we request a 24-bit 
      depth buffer and 8-bit stencil buffer for this device.           </P>
      <H2>Device creation</H2>
      <P>A DirectX device may be created from a given form and with the given 
      present parameters using the following funciton:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let make_device (form : #Form) =
    let flags = CreateFlags.SoftwareVertexProcessing
    new Device(0, DeviceType.Hardware, form, flags, present_params);;
val make_device : #Form -&gt; Device</PRE>
      <P>Note that              <CODE>form</CODE> argument is annotated with the 
      type              <CODE>#Form</CODE> , denoting any subtype of the         
           <CODE>Form</CODE> class. This is useful if we intend to create a new 
      class that derives from the existing              <CODE>Form</CODE> class 
      and we want to pass it as the argument              <CODE>form</CODE> here 
      without having to upcast it to the              <CODE>Form</CODE> type.    
             </P>
      <H2>Painting</H2>
      <P>By default, Windows blanks every form to a background gray color before 
      rendering its contents. When we know that the              
      <CODE>Paint</CODE> method will overwrite the whole of the client rectangle 
      of the form and we will be doing animation, it is necessary to prevent 
      Windows from drawing the background in order to prevent flickering.        
         </P>
      <P>There are two solutions. The conventional C# solution often recommended 
      in existing literature is to call the              <CODE>SetStyle</CODE> 
      member of the form during construction, with something like this:          
       </P>
<PRE>this.SetStyle(ControlStyles.AllPaintingInWmPaint | ControlStyles.Opaque, true);</PRE>
      <P>However, the designers of MDX made the              
      <CODE>SetStyle</CODE> member private, so it cannot be accessed from 
      outside the class, i.e. using idiomatic F# code.           </P>
      <P>A neater alternative is to create a small class derived from            
        <CODE>Form</CODE> that simply overrides the              
      <CODE>PaintBackground</CODE> event with a no-op:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; type Viewer() = class
    inherit Form()
    override form.OnPaintBackground _ = ()
  end;;
type Viewer =
  class
    inherit Form
  end
  with
    new : unit -&gt; Viewer
  end</PRE>
      <P>Any paint event attached to an object of the              
      <CODE>Viewer</CODE> class must redraw every pixel.           </P>
      <P>The task of ensuring that the DirectX device is properly initialized 
      and wrapping the drawing calls with appropriate              
      <CODE>BeginScene</CODE> and              <CODE>EndScene</CODE> calls is 
      neatly encapsulated in a generic higher-order function that can be 
      specialized to the appropriate renderer and attached to the paint event of 
      a              <CODE>Viewer</CODE> object:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let paint (form : #Form) render (device : Device) _ =
    try
      device.TestCooperativeLevel()
      device.BeginScene()
      render device
      device.EndScene()
      device.Present()
      form.Invalidate()
    with
      | :? DeviceLostException -&gt; ()
      | :? DeviceNotResetException -&gt;
          device.Reset(resent_params);;
val paint : #Form -&gt; (Device -&gt; unit) -&gt; Device -&gt; 'b -&gt; unit</PRE>
      <P>The usual DirectX calls required to describe and present a scene are 
      wrapped in an exception handler. Two kinds of exception are handled and in 
      both cases the notation              <CODE>:?</CODE> is used to denote a 
      run-time type test against classes of exception provided by DirectX. This 
      is typical when dealing with exceptions defined by .NET rather than native 
      F# exceptions like              <CODE>Not_found</CODE> . In this case, the 
      call to              <CODE>TestCooperativeLevel</CODE> is the potential 
      source of exceptions. This call is used to ensure that the DirectX device 
      is appropriately initialized and ready. As the exceptions only occur when 
      things go wrong (exceptional circumstances), the performance overhead of 
      exceptions does not slow down normal rendering.           </P>
      <H2>Creating a Viewer</H2>
      <P>The various calls requires to construct a              
      <CODE>Viewer</CODE> object can be wrapped in a higher-order function that 
      is parameterized of the              <CODE>render</CODE> function required 
      by the              <CODE>paint</CODE> function:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let make_viewer title render =
    let form = new Viewer(Text=title, Visible=true)
    form.MinimumSize &lt;- form.Size
    let device = make_device form
    form.Paint.Add(paint form render device)
    form.Resize.Add(fun _ -&gt; form.Invalidate())
    form.KeyDown.Add(fun e -&gt; if e.KeyCode = Keys.Escape then form.Close())
    form.Invalidate();;
val make_viewer : string -&gt; (Device -&gt; unit) -&gt; Viewer</PRE>
      <P>This function begins by creating a new              <CODE>Viewer</CODE> 
      object and setting some properties to give the form a title and display it 
      immediately. The minimum size of the form is set to the current size 
      because DirectX crashes if a device is shrunk to zero area. A DirectX 
      device is then created for the window. The              <CODE>paint</CODE> 
      function is attached to the              <CODE>Paint</CODE> event. By 
      default, the contents of a window are not redisplayed when the window is 
      shrunk, so we override this default behaviour by invalidating the form in 
      the              <CODE>Resize</CODE> event. A handler is added to close 
      then form if the escape key is pressed when the form has the focus. 
      Finally, the form in invalidated to force a redisplay.           </P>
      <H2>First example</H2>
      <P>This boilerplate code is sufficiently encompassing that we can now 
      create a minimal DirectX demo.</P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>render</CODE> function simply clears 
      the display to a single color:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let render (device : Device) =
    device.Clear(ClearFlags.Target, Color.Coral, 1.f, 0);;
val render : Device -&gt; unit</PRE>
      <P>This function may be given to the              <CODE>make_viewer</CODE> 
      function to create a simple visualization:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let form = make_viewer "Blank" render;;
val form : Viewer</PRE>
      <P>When evaluated in an interactive session, the following Window is 
      created:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Introducing%20DirectX_files/mdx1.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>At the time of writing, there are some problems with the use of DirectX 
      visualizations from F# interactive sessions that require some redundant 
      user input to be provided before the visualization will be completely 
      created. Most likely, you will need to press Enter several times after the 
      above code is entered.</P>
      <P>The remainder of this article discusses how F# programs can generate 
      graphics using DirectX.</P>
      <H2>Buffers</H2>
      <P>3D visualizations will require a depth buffer. The code above requested 
      a 24-bit depth buffer, which is ample for most visualizations.</P>
      <P>There are three relevant buffers:</P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Target buffer: this is the actual pixel content displayed on 
        screen</LI>
        <LI>Depth buffer: stores the depth fo each pixel in the scene, allowing 
        the renderer to cull obscured objects.</LI>
        <LI>Stencil buffer: allows a small integer to be accumulated in each 
        pixel and used to filter rendering.</LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>A single value representing all three buffers may be written:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let all_buffers =
    ClearFlags.Target ||| ClearFlags.ZBuffer ||| ClearFlags.Stencil;;
val all_buffers : ClearFlags</PRE>
      <H2>Vectors and Matrices</H2>
      <P>DirectX provides its own implementation of vectors and matrices. The 
      representation used is known as 4D homogeneous coordinates and the use of 
      a fourth dimension allows 3D translations to be represented by a matrix as 
      well as the usual skews, rotations and scalings. A 32-bit float is used to 
      represent each number in a vector or matrix and this corresponds to the    
                <CODE>float32</CODE> type in F#.           </P>
      <P>Vectors are represented by the              <CODE>Vector3</CODE> class 
      and matrices are represented by the              <CODE>Matrix</CODE> 
      class.           </P>
      <H2>Vertices</H2>
      <P>DirectX also provides definitions for vertices in the              
      <CODE>CustomVertex</CODE> class. There are several possible definitions 
      and some include color data whereas others include texture data for each 
      vertex.           </P>
      <P>We shall use a definition that allows position, surface normal and 
      color data to be supplied for each vertex, with the alias:</P>
<PRE>&gt; type Vertex = CustomVertex.PositionNormalColored;;</PRE>
      <P>As vertex positions are more numerous than surface normals (which are 
      shared by flat surfaces) which are in turn more numerous than colors 
      (often shared by entire meshes), it is useful to write a constructor in 
      curried form that allows colors and then normals to be partially 
      applied:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let vertex3 (c : Color) (n : Vector3) (p : Vector3) =
    new Vertex(p.X, p.Y, p.Z, n.X, n.Y, n.Z, c.ToArgb());;
val vertex3 : Color -&gt; float32 * float32 * float32 -&gt; float32 * float32 * float32 -&gt; Vertex</PRE>
      <P>We may also wish to create 2D vertices:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let vertex2 (c : Color) (x, y) =
    new Vertex(x, y, 0.f, 0.f, 0.f, -1.f, c.ToArgb());;
val vertex2 : Color -&gt; float32 * float32 -&gt; Vertex</PRE>
      <P>Scenes can be visualized using a variety of different projections. The 
      two most common projections are orthographic for 2D and perspective for 
      3D.</P>
      <H2>Projection</H2>
      <P>Projections are most easily handled in F# using a combinator that wraps 
      a              <CODE>render</CODE> function with the code required to 
      initialize the projection. In this case, we shall create combinators 
      called              <CODE>show2d</CODE> and              
      <CODE>show3d</CODE> to help visualize 2D and 3D scenes, respectively.      
           </P>
      <H3>Orthographic</H3>
      <P>The following              <CODE>show2d</CODE> combinator provides 
      orthographic projections for 2D graphics:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let show2d render (device : Device) =
    let near = -1.f
    let far = 1.f
    let vp = device.Viewport
    device.Transform.Projection &lt;-
      Matrix.OrthoLH(float32 vp.Width, float32 vp.Height, near, far)
    device.Clear(all_buffers, Color.White, far, 0)
    device.RenderState.Lighting &lt;- false
    device.RenderState.CullMode &lt;- Cull.None
    render device;;
val show2d : (Device -&gt; unit) -&gt; Device -&gt; unit</PRE>
      <P>Note that we are careful to turn off lighting and back-face culling 
      because these are generally undesirable in 2D.</P>
      <P>The area projected by this function is centered at the origin and has 
      dimensions measured in pixels.</P>
      <H3>Perspective Projection</H3>
      <P>The following              <CODE>aspect</CODE> function computes the 
      aspect ratio of the current display:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let aspect (vp : Viewport) =
    float32 vp.Width / float32 vp.Height;;
val aspect : Viewport -&gt; float32</PRE>
      <P>This is used by the following              <CODE>perspective</CODE> 
      function to set a perspective projection:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let perspective aspect near far camera target up (t : Transforms) =
    t.Projection &lt;- Matrix.PerspectiveFovLH(0.8f, aspect, near, far)
    t.View &lt;- Matrix.LookAtLH(camera, target, up);;
val perspective : float32 -&gt; float32 -&gt; float32 -&gt; Vector3 -&gt; Vector3 -&gt; Vector3 -&gt; Transforms -&gt; unit</PRE>
      <P>A default field-of-vision (             <B>FOV</B> ) of 0.8 is used.    
             </P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>show3d</CODE> combinator uses the      
              <CODE>aspect</CODE> and              <CODE>perspective</CODE> 
      functions to render with a 3D perspective projection:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let show3d render (device : Device) =
    let far = 100.f
    let camera = new Vector3(-1.f, 2.f, -4.f)
    let target = new Vector3(0.f, 0.f, 0.f)

val show3d : (Device -&gt; unit) -&gt; Device -&gt; unit</PRE>
      <P>A default view is used, with a camera position, target position and 
      upward direction for the camera. A default light is also placed in the 
      scene.</P>
      <H2>Rendering primitives</H2>
      <P>DirectX allows a variety of primitives to be rendered, including 
      points, lines and triangles. The simplest way to render primitives is by 
      supplying vertex data in the form of a              <CODE>Vertex 
      array</CODE> to the              <CODE>DrawUserPrimitives</CODE> function. 
                </P>
      <P>In the case of triangles, this can be productively encapsulated by the 
      following function:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let draw_triangles (device : Device) (vertex : Vertex array) =
    if vertex &lt;&gt; [||] then
      device.VertexFormat &lt;- Vertex.Format
      let prim = PrimitiveType.TriangleList
      let n = Array.length vertex / 3
      device.DrawUserPrimitives(prim, n, vertex);;
val draw_triangles : Device -&gt; Vertex array -&gt; unit</PRE>
      <P>We are careful to avoid calling the              
      <CODE>DrawUserPrimitives</CODE> function with an empty vertex array as the 
      current DirectX implementation crashes.           </P>
      <P>The use of other primitives, index arrays and static vertex arrays will 
      be covered in future journal articles.</P>
      <H2>Second example</H2>
      <P>The following function draws a single triangle using the              
      <CODE>draw_triangles</CODE> function:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let triangle = [|-100.f, -100.f; 0.f, 100.f; 100.f, -100.f|];;
val triangle : (float32 * float32) array
&gt; let render_triangle (device : Device) =
    Array.map (vertex2 Color.BurlyWood) triangle
    |&gt; draw_triangles device;;
val render_triangle : Device -&gt; unit</PRE>
      <P>This              <CODE>triangle</CODE> function can be used as the     
               <CODE>render</CODE> function with the              
      <CODE>show3d</CODE> combinator.           </P>
      <P>A form visualizing the triangle drawn by this function can be spawned 
      from an F# interactive session using a single line of code:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let form = make_viewer "Triangle" (show2d render_triangle);;
val form : Viewer</PRE>
      <P>This displays the following result:</P>

                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>Future articles will build upon this code base to create more 
      sophisticated visualizations.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
