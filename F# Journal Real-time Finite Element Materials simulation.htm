      <H1>Real-time Finite Element Materials simulation</H1>
      <P>Finite Element Materials simulations (FEMs) model a continuous volume 
      of material by breaking it down into a discrete representation with many 
      finite parts. This article describes a simple but fun program that 
      simulates the dynamics of a 2D system of particles and springs in 
      real-time. The program includes an interactive GUI visualization based 
      upon Windows Presentation Foundation.</P>
      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P>FEMs is a widely used technique found in many areas of science and 
      engineering, from the modelling of stresses in screwdriver heads to the 
      simulation of fluid dynamics in oil fields. This article takes a more 
      relaxed approach to FEMs and builds a simple toy that is very educational 
      in elucidating how the technique works and, in particular, how fragile 
      they can be.</P>
      <P>Dynamical systems are typically simulated using discrete-time numerical 
      integrators to integrate the equations of motion as a function of time. 
      This application is no exception and we shall apply the Euler method for 
      numerically integrating ordinary differential equations to Newton's 
      equations of motion:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Real-time%20Finite%20Element%20Materials%20simulation_files/euler.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>At a given time step, the acceleration of each particle is accumulated 
      starting with the acceleration due to gravity and adding the acceleration 
      due to forces from springs that act between particles. The springs simply 
      obey Hooke's law, exerting a force proportional to their extension from 
      their equilibrium length.</P>
      <H2>Simulation</H2>
      <P>This "simulator.ml" file contains the definitions responsible for the 
      adaptive real-time simulation of the dynamics of the scene. This starts 
      with the following preamble:</P>

#r @"PresentationFramework.dll"</PRE>
<PRE>open System.Windows</PRE>
      <P>The following function computes the length of a 2D vector represented 
      as a value of the              <CODE>Vector</CODE> type from Windows 
      Presentation Foundation:           </P>
<PRE>let length (r : Vector) = sqrt(r*r)</PRE>
      <P>The following constant vector is used to represent the acceleration due 
      to gravity:</P>
<PRE>let gravity = Vector(0., -1.)</PRE>
      <P>The stiffness of the springs (the constant in Hooke's law) is a global 
      value in this program:</P>
<PRE>let mutable stiffness = 400000.</PRE>
      <P>The              <CODE>point</CODE> and              
      <CODE>spring</CODE> record types represent the two fundamental types in 
      our dynamical system, which consists of particles and springs connecting 
      them:           </P>
<PRE>type point = { mutable position: Vector; mutable velocity: Vector }
type spring = { mutable end1: int; mutable end2: int; mutable length: float }</PRE>
      <P>Each point is quantified by its position and velocity. Each spring is 
      quantified by the index of the start and end points in the point array of 
      the system and its equilibrium length.</P>
      <P>The following helper function builds a spring with a default length 
      that is the current separation between the particles at the ends of the 
      spring:</P>
<PRE>let spring (points : _ array) i j =
  { end1 = i; end2 = j;
    length = length(points.[j].position - points.[i].position) }</PRE>
      <P>Mouse interaction requires the current position of the mouse and a 
      value representing the index of the point currently being grabbed, if 
      any:</P>
<PRE>let mutable mouse_position = Vector(0., 0.)
let mutable mouse_grab = None</PRE>
      <P>The following              <CODE>update_accelerations</CODE> function 
      is the first of two stages required to update the dynamics of the scene. 
      This function loops over the springs in the system and updates the 
      accelerations of the particles at either end:           </P>
<PRE>let update_accelerations dt (acceleration : _ array) (points : _ array) (springs : _ array) =
  match mouse_grab with
  | None -&gt; ()
  | Some i -&gt;
      let dr = points.[i].position - mouse_position
      let separation = length dr
      let force = 1000. * dr
      acceleration.[i] &lt;- acceleration.[i] - force
  for spring in springs do
    if spring.end1 &lt;&gt; spring.end2 then
      let p1 = points.[spring.end1]
      let p2 = points.[spring.end2]
      let dr = p2.position - p1.position
      let separation = length dr
      let elongation = spring.length / separation in
      let max = 1.2
      if abs elongation &gt; max then
        spring.end2 &lt;- spring.end1
      let force = (1.0 - spring.length / separation) * stiffness * dr
      acceleration.[spring.end1] &lt;- acceleration.[spring.end1] + force
      acceleration.[spring.end2] &lt;- acceleration.[spring.end2] - force
      updates &lt;- updates + 1</PRE>
      <P>Note that springs exceeding a maximum length are snapped by setting the 
      end points to be the same. This allows the program to simulate the 
      smashing of objects.</P>
      <P>The mouse grabbing one of the points in the system is modeled via an 
      invisible zero equilibrium-length spring connecting that point to the 
      current mouse coordinate.</P>
      <P>The second stage of updating is implemented by the following            
        <CODE>update_positions</CODE> function that loops over the particles in 
      the system and updates the position and velocity of each particle 
      according to its acceleration (integrating over time using the Euler 
      method):           </P>
<PRE>let update_positions dt (acceleration : Vector array) (points : _ array) (springs : _ array) =
  for i=0 to points.Length - 1 do
    let r = points.[i].position
    let dr = points.[i].velocity
    let ddr = acceleration.[i]
    let mutable dr : Vector = dr + dt * ddr
    if r.Y &lt; 0.0 &amp;&amp; dr.Y &lt; 0.0 then
      dr.X &lt;- 0.9 * dr.X
      dr.Y &lt;- -0.9 * dr.Y
    if r.X &lt; 0.0 &amp;&amp; dr.X &lt; 0. then
      dr.X &lt;- -0.9 * dr.X
      dr.Y &lt;- 0.9 * dr.Y
    if r.X &gt; 1.0 &amp;&amp; dr.X &gt; 0. then
      dr.X &lt;- -dr.X
      dr.Y &lt;- 0.9 * dr.Y
    let dr = 0.9 ** dt * dr
    points.[i].position &lt;- r + dt * dr
    points.[i].velocity &lt;- dr</PRE>
      <P>Note that the velocity              <CODE>dr</CODE> is updated and then 
      adjusted by impacts with the walls and floor              <I>before</I> it 
      is used to update the position.           </P>
      <P>The core function in this entire program is then the following          
          <CODE>update</CODE> function:           </P>
<PRE>let rec update dt (points : _ array) (springs : _ array) =
  if dt &gt; 1e-4 then
    update (0.5 * dt) points springs
    update (0.5 * dt) points springs
  else
    let n = Array.length points
    let acceleration = Array.create n gravity
    update_accelerations dt acceleration points springs
    update_positions dt acceleration points springs</PRE>
      <P>The arguments to this function are the length of time it is to 
      integrate over and the arrays of points and springs in the particle 
      system. For large time spans, this function bisects the time span and 
      calls itself twice. Numerical integration is inherently approximate and 
      this subdivision helps to keep the error under control.</P>
      <P>The              <CODE>update</CODE> function then creates an array of 
      the accelerations of each particle in the system, initially with the 
      acceleration due to gravity. In the              
      <CODE>update_accelerations</CODE> function, each spring is then considered 
      in turn and the force exerted by each spring is used to update the 
      acceleration of the two particles at its ends. The force is calculated 
      using Hooke's law which states that the force exerted by a spring is 
      proportional to its displacement from equilibrium multiplied by the 
      springs stiffness. We assume unit mass for each particle.           </P>
      <P>Once the accelerations have been calculated, the particles are updated 
      in-place by the              <CODE>update_positions</CODE> function using 
      the Euler method augmented with some tests to ensure that velocities are 
      reflected by collisions with the walls and floor. Also, as a primitive 
      simulation of friction, any impact with the floor zeroes the horizontal 
      component of the velocity. In particular, note that the velocity is 
      updated with the current acceleration              <I>before</I> tests for 
      collisions are performed. This ensures that the velocity is corrected 
      before it is used to update the position. Collision with the floor (when 
      both the position is below the floor and the velocity is directed 
      downwards) damp the vertical component of the velocity. The velocity is 
      also slightly damped every time step by a factor 0.9             
      <SUP>dt</SUP> to prevent numerical errors from accumulating and increasing 
      the total energy in the system.           </P>
      <P>The following builds an example particle system starting with an 
      H-shaped layout of particles and then placing springs between all 
      sufficiently-close particles:</P>
<PRE>let points, springs =
  let n = 18
  let s = 0.02
  let points =
    [|for i in 0 .. n-1
        for j in 0 .. n-1
            when (j&lt;2 || j&gt;(n-3)) || (i=n/2 || i=n/2-1) -&gt;
          Vector(s * float i, s * float j)|]
  let points =
    points
    |&gt; Array.map (( + ) (Vector(0.1, 0.)))
    |&gt; Array.map (fun r -&gt; {position=r; velocity=Vector(0., 0.)})
  let springs = ref []
  let n = Array.length points
  let limit = 1.5 * s
  for i=0 to n-2 do
    for j=i+1 to n-1 do
      let p1 = points.[i].position
      let p2 = points.[j].position
      if length(p2 - p1) &lt; limit then
        springs := spring points i j :: !springs;
  let springs = Array.of_list !springs in
  points, springs</PRE>
      <P>The following function runs a dynamical simulation indefinitely, using 
      the time span since the last iteration to call the              
      <CODE>update</CODE> function repeatedly:           </P>

        | Some old -&gt; old
      past := Some now
      float(now - old) / 1e3
    update dt points springs</PRE>
      <P>This              <CODE>simulate</CODE> function is then started on a

      <H2>Summary</H2>
      <P>This article has described a simple but effective real-time soft object 
      simulator that uses a finite element methods for the simulation and 
      Windows Presentation Foundation for visualization. The practical 
      applications of this particular kind of simulation are primarily rag-doll 
      models for computer games due to its real-time nature.</P>
      <P>The computational complexity of this program is focused in a pair of 
      loops that mutate the particle system in-place. The majority of the 
      program is, therefore, free to benefit from the heavy use of functional 
      programming as a means of abstraction to reduce code size without 
      adversely affecting performance. Moreover, the performance intensive loops 
      are also amenable to parallelization.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
