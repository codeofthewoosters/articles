      <H1>How to leverage pattern matching</H1>
      <P>Most languages provide a construct that allows the flow of execution to 
      take one of several different paths depending on the value that an 
      expression evaluates to. This feature is often referred to as              
      <I>dynamic dispatch</I> .           </P>
      <P>Compared to conventional programming languages, F# takes dynamic 
      dispatch to a whole new level using an approach called              
      <I>pattern matching</I> . This article guides the reader through the 
      fundamental concepts that underpin pattern matching before providing some 
      examples demonstrating the power of pattern matching in general 
      programming.           </P>
      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P>Pattern matching is powerful for two main reasons:</P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Patterns can detect the structure of a value, e.g. the shape of a 
        tree.</LI>
        <LI>Patterns can bind variables to parts of a value.</LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>When used in combination, these two properties allow data structures to 
      be dissected using pattern matching. Consequently, F# code that dissects 
      data structures is typically both concise and comprehensible.</P>
      <P>In F#, a pattern match is described explicitly using either the         
           <CODE>match ... with</CODE> construct or the              
      <CODE>function ...</CODE> construct. The latter is shorthand for an 
      anonymous function that pattern matches over its argument              
      <CODE>x</CODE> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; fun x -&gt;
    match x with
    | pattern -&gt; expression
    | pattern -&gt; expression
    | pattern -&gt; expression
    | ...</PRE>
      <P>We shall use both the              <CODE>match ... with</CODE> and      
              <CODE>function ...</CODE> constructs in the remainder of this 
      article.           </P>
      <H2>Binding variables</H2>
      <P>Data structures are dissected using pattern matching by binding 
      variables to parts of the data structure. Bound variables can then be used 
      in the right-hand side of the pattern matching construct.</P>
      <P>The following function sums the integers in a list by adding the head 
      of the list (the first element) to the sum of the tail (the remaining 
      elements) until the base case of the empty list is reached, whose sum is 
      zero:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec sum = function
    | [] -&gt; 0
    | head :: tail -&gt; head + sum tail;;
sum : int list -&gt; int</PRE>
      <P>For example,              <I>1+2+3 = 6</I> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; sum [1; 2; 3];;
val it : int = 6</PRE>
      <P>The second pattern in the              <CODE>sum</CODE> function 
      matches any list with at least one element, binding the variables          
          <CODE>head</CODE> to the first element of the list and              
      <CODE>tail</CODE> to the list containing the remaining elements. The       
             <CODE>head</CODE> and              <CODE>tail</CODE> variables may 
      then be used in the corresponding expression.           </P>
      <P>By applying itself to the tail list, this              <CODE>sum</CODE> 
      function recursively decomposes the list one element at a time. Dissecting 
      data structures using recursion is a very common style in F# programming.  
               </P>
      <H2>Or patterns</H2>
      <P>In many cases, several alternative patterns can lead to the same 
      expression. Such cases are handled using "or patterns". When any of a 
      sequence of subpatterns is allowed to match, the pattern              
      <CODE>A | B | ...</CODE> may be used.           </P>
      <P>Consider the factorial function. We have both              <I>0! = 
      1</I> and              <I>1! = 1</I> . This may be implemented in F# using 
      an or-pattern:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec factorial = function
    | 0 | 1 -&gt; 1
    | n -&gt; n * factorial(n - 1);;
val factorial : int -&gt; int</PRE>
      <P>For example, the factorials of              <I>0 .. 5</I> are:          
       </P>
<PRE>&gt; Seq.map factorial {0 .. 5};;
val it : int seq = {1; 1; 2; 6; 24; 120}</PRE>
      <P>Note the use of the or-pattern              <CODE>0 | 1</CODE> in this 
      code, matching either 0 or 1 and returning the result 1 in both cases.     
            </P>
      <P>Or patterns can often be used to simplify complicated pattern matches 
      and, consequently, it is worth considering their use while designing F# 
      programs.</P>
      <H2>Named patterns</H2>
      <P>As we have already seen, the branches of a data structure (such as the 
      head and tail of a list) can be bound to variables by a pattern match. In 
      some cases, a branch of a data structure must match a more specific 
      pattern as well as being bound to a variable. Such cases as handled using  
                  <I>named patterns</I> . The value matching a pattern           
         <CODE>pat</CODE> can be bound to a variable              <CODE>x</CODE> 
      using the syntax              <CODE>pat as x</CODE> .           </P>
      <P>Consider the example or-pattern              <CODE>0 | 1</CODE> from 
      the previous section. The              <CODE>factorial</CODE> function did 
      not care whether the matched value was a zero or a one. However, a 
      different function might need to know the value that matched. This is done 
      by naming the pattern with              <CODE>0 | 1 as n</CODE> and using 
      the variable              <CODE>n</CODE> in the corresponding expression.  
               </P>
      <P>A function              <CODE>fib</CODE> to compute the Fibonacci 
      numbers can benefit from this feature. We can define base cases of         
           <CODE>fib 0 = 0</CODE> and              <CODE>fib 1 = 1</CODE> . 
      Thus, the Fibonacci function can be written as an initial pattern that 
      matches these two base cases with the named or-pattern              
      <CODE>0 | 1 as n</CODE> and returns the value              <CODE>n</CODE> 
      that was matched, either a 0 or a 1:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec fib = function
    | 0 | 1 as n -&gt; n
    | n -&gt; fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);;
val fib : int -&gt; int</PRE>
      <P>For example, the first few Fibonacci numbers are:</P>
<PRE>&gt; Seq.map fib {0 .. 5};;
val it : int seq = {0; 1; 1; 2; 3; 5}</PRE>
      <P>Named patterns are less common than or-patterns but offer significant 
      benefits in many circumstances.</P>
      <H2>Parallel pattern matching</H2>
      <P>Several values can be dissected at once using pattern matching by 
      analyzing the values in parallel. This is written as a simple pattern 
      match over a tuple containing the values being dissected. Although this 
      use-case requires no new fancy syntax or semantics, it is worth noting 
      independently because it is both useful and efficient.</P>
      <P>Consider a function that looks up the element in a list at the given 
      index. This function can be written by pattern matching over the index and 
      the list simultaneously:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec nth n list =
    match n, list with
    | 0, head :: _ -&gt; head
    | _, [] -&gt; raise Not_found
    | n, _ :: tail -&gt; nth (n - 1) tail;;
val nth : int -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'a</PRE>
      <P>For example, extracting the element at index 3:</P>
<PRE>&gt; nth 3 [5 .. 10];;
val it : int = 8</PRE>
      <P>This function analyzes the index              <CODE>n</CODE> and the 
      list              <CODE>list</CODE> in parallel, dispatching execution to 
      one of three cases:           </P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Zero index and a list with at least one element: return the head 
        element.</LI>
        <LI>Any index and the empty list: index was out of bounds.</LI>
        <LI>Non-zero index and non-empty list: search the tail list.</LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>The ability to dissect multiple data structures simultaneously can be 
      of great benefit.</P>
      <H2>Static checking</H2>
      <P>The F# compiler checks pattern matches at compile-time to ensure that 
      they are exhaustive (all possible inputs match at least one pattern, i.e. 
      no value can "escape" the pattern match) and contain no redundant patterns 
      (patterns that can never be reached because a previous pattern matches a 
      superset of values). Any inexhaustive or redundant patterns incur a 
      warning and should be addressed by the programmer before the program is 
      run.</P>
      <H3>Exhaustiveness</H3>
      <P>For example, the following function returns              
      <CODE>true</CODE> if it is given the empty list              
      <CODE>[]</CODE> but has no pattern to match the non-empty list. 
      Consequently, the compiler issues a warning:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let is_empty list = match list with
    | [] -&gt; true;;
Warning: FS0025: Incomplete pattern match
val is_empty : 'a list -&gt; bool</PRE>
      <P>In this case, the pattern match is easily completed by adding the 
      catch-all pattern              <CODE>_</CODE> , or the more specific       
             <CODE>_::_</CODE> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let is_empty list = match list with
    | [] -&gt; true
    | _::_ -&gt; false;;
val is_empty : 'a list -&gt; bool</PRE>
      <P>As this function pattern matches over its argument, it is an ideal 
      candidate for the more succinct              <CODE>function</CODE> 
      construct:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let is_empty = function
    | [] -&gt; true
    | _::_ -&gt; false;;
val is_empty : 'a list -&gt; bool</PRE>
      <P>Being warned about inexhaustive pattern matches is particularly useful 
      when pattern matches grow to be very long and the sets of values matched 
      are not obvious.</P>
      <H3>Redundancy</H3>
      <P>The last pattern in the following function is redundant because it can 
      never be reached:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let is_empty = function
    | [] -&gt; true
    | _::_ -&gt; false
    | _ -&gt; false;;
Warning: FS0026: This rule will never be matched.
val is_empty : 'a list -&gt; bool</PRE>
      <P>As the first two patterns match all possible lists, the third pattern 
      is redundant. The compiler detects this and issues a warning 
      automatically.</P>
      <P>Checking for exhaustiveness and redundancy in pattern matches are just 
      two of many approaches that the F# language takes to tracking down errors 
      before a program is run. In many cases, the interpretation of a pattern 
      match is so natural for a human that any such errors are due to the 
      programmer incorrectly transcribing their design into code, e.g. a simple 
      typographical error.</P>
      <P>We have now covered all of the core features of pattern matching in F#. 
      Whenever possible, pattern matches should be written in terms of 
      constants, variables, or-patterns and named patterns. This maximizes the 
      benefits of static checking and the performance that results. However, 
      some situations warrant more sophisticated functionality in the pattern 
      matcher at the expense of static checking and efficiency.</P>
      <H2>Guarded patterns</H2>
      <P>Sometimes, pattern matches can be written more elegantly by 
      constraining specific patterns to only match under certain circumstances. 
      This can be achieved by placing a boolean expression called a              
      <I>guard</I> on the pattern. A guarded pattern is only allowed to match 
      when the guard expression evaluates to              <CODE>true</CODE> .    
             </P>
      <P>Guarded patterns have several drawbacks that limit their use:</P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Guard expressions must be evaluated at run-time and, consequently, 
        they prohibit certain compile-time pattern-matching optimizations.</LI>
        <LI>Guards may be executed non-deterministically and, consequently, they 
        should always be pure expressions (without side-effects).</LI>
        <LI>Guards obviate some static checking, often requiring extra work to 
        eliminate compiler warnings.</LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>A boolean guard expression              <CODE>g</CODE> is added to a 
      pattern using the syntax              <CODE>| pat when g -&gt; ...</CODE>
       . Note that guards can only be added to top-most patterns and not to 
      subpatterns.           </P>
      <P>The most obvious use of guarded patterns is to circumvent the inability 
      to duplicate pattern variables in F#. This restriction is imposed by the 
      F# language because, without it, a single pattern match could take an 
      arbitrary amount of time to compute.</P>
      <P>The following function              <CODE>dups</CODE> returns the 
      elements from the list              <CODE>l1</CODE> for which the 
      corresponding element in the list              <CODE>l2</CODE> is not 
      equal:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec dups l1 l2 =
    match l1, l2 with
    | [], [] -&gt; []
    | h1::t1, h2::t2 when h1=h2 -&gt; dups t1 t2
    | h::t1, _::t2 -&gt; h::dups t1 t2
    | _ -&gt; invalid_arg "dups";;
val dups : 'a list -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'a list</PRE>
      <P>For example, only the elements 2, 3 and 5 have different valued 
      elements in the second list:</P>
<PRE>&gt; dups [1; 2; 3; 4; 5] [1; 1; 4; 4; 4];;
val it : int list = [2; 3; 5]</PRE>
      <P>When performance is not critical, guarded patterns can be a useful way 
      to simplify pattern matches.</P>
      <H2>Performance</H2>
      <P>Given the power of pattern matching, you might be forgiven for assuming 
      that it is slow. In fact, pattern matching is very, very fast. In simple 
      cases like the              <CODE>factorial</CODE> function, pattern 
      matching is as fast as an              <CODE>if</CODE> expression. In more 
      complicated cases, the static analysis performed by the F# compiler 
      rearranges patterns into optimized decision trees and performance is 
      typically much better than hand-coded sequences of              
      <CODE>if</CODE> expressions.           </P>
      <P>Pattern matching is one of the most useful features of F#. In addition 
      to providing an elegant and efficient means to dispatch computation, 
      pattern matches are subjected to static checks beyond static type 
      checking. Thus, the use of pattern matching accelerates development and 
      improves both reliability and performance.</P>
      <H2>Active Patterns</H2>
      <P>The F# language is derived from the              <A href="http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/ocaml_for_scientists/">OCaml</A> 
      language. We have now covered the whole of OCaml-style pattern matching. 
      In addition to these features, F# also provides an exciting new feature 
      called              <I>active patterns</I> .           </P>
      <P>As we have seen, pattern matching allows the programmer to dissect 
      concrete data structures by dispatching computation based upon the 
      structure and contents of a value. This offers many advantages over more 
      conventional approaches to dynamic dispatch, such as virtual functions, 
      but has the disadvantage that over-use of pattern matching and the 
      inappropriate factoring of code can lead to programs that are overly 
      dependent upon a particular concrete data structure, such as lists.</P>
      <P>A few academic papers have addressed this concern by proposing 
      so-called "views". A view is a set of abstract patterns that give one 
      concrete data structure the appearance of another.</P>
      <P>The simplest example demonstrating the utility of active patterns is 
      actually provided in the F# distribution itself, in the form of the active 
      patterns              <CODE>Nil</CODE> and              <CODE>Cons</CODE> 
      in the              <CODE>LazyList</CODE> module that allow lazy lists to 
      be dissected as if they were eager lists.           </P>
      <P>Active patterns particularly important in the context of 
      interoperability, such as the .NET platform, where libraries implemented 
      in other languages could be exposed much more elegantly in F#.</P>
      <P>The .NET representation of XML data is an obfuscated mess of object 
      oriented design that could be much more elegantly exposed in F# as a 
      simple variant type containing element nodes and text leaves. Fortunately, 
      active patterns allow us to bridge the gap, giving the .NET implementation 
      of XML the look and feel of a native F# library.</P>
      <P>The following function extracts the tag name and attribute- and 
      child-lists from an XML element node, returning them as a 3-tuple:</P>
<PRE>&gt; open System.Xml;;
&gt; let element (elt : XmlElement) =
    elt.LocalName,
    [for i in 0 .. elt.Attributes.Count - 1 -&gt;
       let a = elt.Attributes.Item(i)
       a.Name, a.Value],
    [for i in 0 .. elt.ChildNodes.Count - 1 -&gt;
       elt.ChildNodes.Item(i)];;
val element : XmlElement -&gt; string * (string * string) list * XmlNode list</PRE>
      <P>This can be used to write an active pattern that makes an              
      <CODE>XmlNode</CODE> object appear to be either an              
      <CODE>Element</CODE> or              <CODE>Text</CODE> constructor:        
         </P>
<PRE>&gt; let (|Element|Text|) (n : XmlNode) =
    match n.NodeType with
    | XmlNodeType.Element -&gt; Element(element(n :?&gt; XmlElement))
    | XmlNodeType.Text -&gt; Text n.InnerText
    | _ -&gt; invalid_arg "node";;
val (|Element|Text|) :
  XmlNode -&gt; Choice&lt;(string * (string * string) list * XmlNode list), string&gt;</PRE>
      <P>Functions that act upon XML data may now be written more elegantly 
      using these active patterns. For example, a function to return the child 
      nodes of the first element with the given tag name (analogous to the       
             <CODE>List.assoc</CODE> function) may be written:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec assoc tag = function
    | [] -&gt; raise Not_found
    | Element(tag', _, nodes) :: _ when tag=tag' -&gt; nodes
    | _ :: tail -&gt; assoc tag tail;;
val assoc : string -&gt; XmlNode list -&gt; XmlNode list</PRE>
      <P>This function may now be used to dissect XML data without having to 
      translate the .NET representation into an F# representation and without 
      forcing the .NET design onto the F# programmer.</P>
      <P>This concludes our article on pattern matching in F#. Pattern matching 
      will be used extensively in later journal articles, so watch out for the 
      design decisions and properties that were covered in this article.</P>
