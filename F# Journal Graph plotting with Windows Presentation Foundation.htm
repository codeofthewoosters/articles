      <H1>Graph plotting with Windows Presentation Foundation</H1>
      <P>The advent of the .NET Framework 3.0 brings an exciting new technology 
      to the Windows platform for the first time: hardware-accelerated vector 
      graphics as part of Windows Presentation Foundation. This part of 
      Microsoft's standard library allows programmers to define 
      resolution-independent vector graphics in the form of arbitrary paths and 
      shapes and visualize them in an interactive GUI. This article describes 
      how these features can be used in F# programs and builds a simple graph 
      plotter as an example.</P>
      <H2>Introducing Windows Presentation Foundation</H2>
      <P>Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a key component of the .NET 
      Framework 3.0, providing richer and more compelling applications including 
      traditional graphical user interfaces alongside 2D and 3D graphics, 
      multimedia, animation, dynamic sketching, rich documents, speech 
      recognition and many more features.</P>
      <P>However, the vast majority of tutorial information currently available 
      about WPF has two major shortcomings in the context of F#:</P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Assumes static content, aimed at the layout of graphical user 
        interfaces for ordinary Windows applications, when F# users will often 
        be interested in creating sophisticated dynamic content computed 
        on-the-fly by F# programs.</LI>
        <LI>Assumes the creation of standalone applications with no use of 
        threading when F# users will more often be interested in multithreaded 
        WPF-based GUI applications spawned from and running concurrently with F# 
        interactive sessions.</LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>This and future F#.NET Journal articles will address these issues by 
      describing how WPF can be used from F# programmatically and 
      concurrently.</P>
      <H2>Static content for Windows Presentation Foundation</H2>
      <P>Perhaps the single most valued aspect of WPF is the creation of 
      next-generation GUIs for Windows Vista and beyond, such as the layout of 
      controls for the following example rich-UI application:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Graph%20plotting%20with%20Windows%20Presentation%20Foundation_files/wpf_example.jpg"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>The static content defining the layout of such a user interface is 
      typically written and stored in Extensible Application Markup Language 
      (XAML) files, an XML-based format designed specifically for WPF.</P>
      <P>However, many important user interfaces require the use of arbitrary 
      computation, either because the layout of the interface is significantly 
      more complicated (e.g. visualizations of 3D MRI scans) or because the 
      content is inherently functional. A graph plotter is a simple example of 
      such an interface because the graph axes and contents require some 
      computation. These applications are best written in a conventional 
      programming language using WPF's programmatic API.</P>
      <H2>Threading in Windows Presentation Foundation</H2>
      <P>In the context of threading, the MSDN documentation for WPF says:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="font-style: italic; margin-right: 5%; margin-left: 5%;">"Windows 
      Presentation Foundation (WPF) is designed to save developers from the 
      difficulties of threading. As a result, the majority of WPF developers 
      won't have to write an interface that uses more than one thread. Because 
      multithreaded programs are complex and difficult to debug, they should be 
      avoided when single-threaded solutions exist." -                <A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms741870.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms741870.aspx</A> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>In other words, WPF is designed to make it easy for C# programmers to 
      write GUI applications with a minimal use of threads. This is an admirable 
      goal but is in direct conflict with elegant use of WPF from an F# 
      interactive session because such applications must be run concurrently or 
      they will block the F# interactive session. This would make the session 
      unusable until the GUI application completes which is, of course, not 
      acceptable.</P>
      <P>In fact, a consequence of evading threading issues in WPF is a lack of 
      documentation and advice surrounding the use of threaded WPF applications, 
      particularly those designed to run concurrently as a background task (e.g. 
      spawned from a main F# interactive session). Consequently, it is 
      absolutely essential to pay the utmost attention to threading issues when 
      writing F# programs that are designed to be run from F# interactive 
      sessions. This article endeavours to describe the many potential pitfalls 
      that await F# programmers using WPF!</P>
      <H2>Using Windows Presentation Foundation in F# programs</H2>
      <P>Setting up an F# program to use Windows Presentation Foundation could 
      not be easier. You simply provide the appropriate include path to the DLLs 
      and reference the relevant DLLs themselves:</P>
<PRE>&gt; #light;;
&gt; #I @"C:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\v3.0";;
&gt; #r @"WindowsBase.dll";;
&gt; #r @"PresentationCore.dll";;
&gt; #r @"PresentationFramework.dll";;</PRE>
      <P>Windows Presentation Foundation augments the              
      <CODE>System.Windows</CODE> namespace with a hierarchy of new namespaces 
      and definitions. This example program uses definitions from the following 
      namespaces:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; open System;;
&gt; open System.Windows;;
&gt; open System.Windows.Media;;</PRE>
      <P>The remainder of this article describes the construction of windows 
      that view vector graphics content, the generation of vector graphics 
      content and, finally, the design of concurrent WPF applications that work 
      reliably both as standalone compiled applications and when spawned from F# 
      interactive sessions.</P>
      <H2>Windows, Visuals, Drawings and DrawingVisuals</H2>
      <P>The              <CODE>System.Windows.Form</CODE> class from Windows 
      Forms is now superceded by the              
      <CODE>System.Windows.Window</CODE> class for Windows Presentation 
      Foundation.           </P>
      <P>The new              <CODE>System.Windows.Media.Visual</CODE> class 
      encapsulates the low-level infrastructure required to draw into a window. 
      The derived class              
      <CODE>System.Windows.Media.DrawingVisual</CODE> can be used to render 
      vector graphics.           </P>
      <P>A class derived from the              <CODE>Window</CODE> may be used 
      to render a              <CODE>DrawingVisual</CODE> by adding the visual 
      as both a visual and logical child to itself using its              
      <CODE>AddVisualChild</CODE> and              <CODE>AddLogicalChild</CODE> 
      members, respectively, and overriding the              
      <CODE>VisualChildrenCount</CODE> property and              
      <CODE>GetVisualChild</CODE> member to return one and the value of the 
      visual, respectively. The following derived class              
      <CODE>VisualWindow</CODE> does exactly this:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; type VisualWindow(visual) as this =
    inherit Window(Title="Graph plotter", Width=600., Height=650.)
    
    do
      this.ResizeMode &lt;- ResizeMode.NoResize
      this.AddVisualChild visual
      this.AddLogicalChild visual
      this.KeyDown.Add(fun e -&gt; if e.Key = Input.Key.Escape then this.Close())
    
    override w.VisualChildrenCount = 1
    
    override w.GetVisualChild(i) =
      if i=0 then visual else raise Not_found;;
type VisualWindow = class
                      inherit Window
                    end
                    with
                      new : visual:Visual -&gt; VisualWindow
                    end</PRE>
      <P>This definition of the              <CODE>VisualWindow</CODE> class has 
      some interesting properties:           </P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>This class uses an implicit constructor, taking the                  
        <CODE>visual</CODE> value of the abstract base class                  
        <CODE>Visual</CODE> .               </LI>
        <LI>The first line of this class definition names the new object         
                 <CODE>this</CODE> when it is constructed, in order to provide 
        access to its own properties and members within the body of its 
        definition.               </LI>
        <LI>The base class                  <CODE>Window</CODE> that our         
                 <CODE>VisualWindow</CODE> derives from is constructed in the 
        second line, including setting the window title and size using the       
                   <CODE>Title</CODE> ,                  <CODE>Width</CODE> and  
                        <CODE>Height</CODE> properties. Note that WPF uses 
        floating point size measurements because it can handle 
        resolution-independent graphics.               </LI>
        <LI>The initialization calls are made inside a                  
        <CODE>do</CODE> block, including adding a new callback for the           
               <CODE>KeyDown</CODE> event that closes the window if the escape 
        key is pressed.               </LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>This class can now be used to create windows that visualize vector 
      graphics.</P>
      <H2>Drawing text</H2>
      <P>As a powerful and culture-agnostic library, WPF allows a variety of 
      different writing styles to be used for text. This even includes the 
      ability to render text from scripts that are drawn from right to left. To 
      create a simple vector graphic representing an English              
      <CODE>string</CODE> (such as a number in the case of our graph plotter), 
      it is useful to have a function that fills in suitable defaults. The 
      following              <CODE>text</CODE> function does exactly this:       
          </P>
<PRE>  let text string =
    FormattedText(string,
		  System.Globalization.CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-us"),
		  FlowDirection.LeftToRight,
		  Typeface("Verdana"),
		  15.,
		  Brushes.White);;
val text : string -&gt; FormattedText</PRE>
      <P>Note how the              <CODE>new</CODE> keyword is not required when 
      constructing an object of the              <CODE>FormattedText</CODE> 
      class. In fact, the              <CODE>new</CODE> keyword is only 
      recommended in F# for classes that implement the              
      <CODE>IDisposable</CODE> interface. In latter examples, this makes the 
      code substantially more concise, e.g. when constructing many objects of 
      the              <CODE>Point</CODE> class.           </P>
      <H2>Building a PathGeometry</H2>
      <P>The              <CODE>PathGeometry</CODE> class encapsulates a 
      sequence of open or closed              <CODE>PathFigure</CODE> objects. 
      In this case, each              <CODE>PathGeometry</CODE> will only 
      contain a single              <CODE>PathFigure</CODE> and each             
       <CODE>PathFigure</CODE> will only contain a sequence of straight-line 
      segments (as opposed to elliptic arcs and cubic Bezier curves). So the 
      following helper function              <CODE>line</CODE> can be used to 
      construct a              <CODE>PathGeometry</CODE> for a line loop that 
      may or may not be closed:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let line is_closed ((sx, sy), segs) =
    let segs =
      { for x, y in segs -&gt;
	  LineSegment(Point(x, y), true) :&gt; PathSegment }
    PathGeometry([PathFigure(Point(sx, sy), segs, is_closed)]);;
val line : bool -&gt; (float * float) * #seq&lt;float * float&gt; -&gt; PathGeometry</PRE>
      <P>There are two main points of interest about the implementation of this 
      function:</P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>The                  <CODE>segs</CODE> argument is superceded by a 
        value that is created using a sequence comprehension. This make no 
        assumptions about the                  <CODE>segs</CODE> argument and, 
        consequently, F# infers the type of                  <CODE>segs</CODE> 
        to be any sequence, i.e. any subset of the                  
        <CODE>seq</CODE> type which is denoted                  
        <CODE>#seq</CODE> .               </LI>
        <LI>The                  <CODE>PathFigure</CODE> constructor requires 
        the start coordinate to be specified independently from the rest of the 
        path and, consequently, the path must contain at least one point. The 
        type                  <CODE>'a * 'a seq</CODE> is used to represent a 
        sequence with at least one element. This is an excellent way to leverage 
        static type checking to ensure that a sufficient number of values are 
        passed to a function and have the compiler automatically verify this 
        rather than having to resort to run-time tests.               </LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <H2>Linear interpolation</H2>
      <P>The following helper function is a numerically robust alternative to 
      the old floating point range comprehension provided by F#:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let interp n x0 x1 =
    { for i in 0 .. n-1 -&gt;
        x0 + float i / float(n-1) * (x1 - x0) };;
val interp : int -&gt; float -&gt; float -&gt; seq&lt;float&gt;</PRE>
      <P>This function is useful in many different circumstances and will be 
      used to interpolate the              <I>x</I> coordinates across the graph 
      in this case. The F# standard library will doubtless provide its own 
      implementation in the future.           </P>
      <H2>Labelling axes</H2>
      <P>One of the hidden complexities in a graph plotter is the mathematical 
      description of how the ticks on each axis can be laid out esthetically. 
      For most graphs and charts, this is typically done by rounding the spacing 
      of ticks to the nearest integer multiple of 1, 2 or 5 times the nearest 
      power of 10 and spacing ticks out from the origin.</P>
      <P>The following function does precisely this by rounding the              
      <CODE>optimal</CODE> number to one of the nearest              
      <CODE>multiples</CODE> of a power of the              <CODE>base</CODE> 
      number:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let closest multiples base optimal =
    let multiplier = base ** floor(log optimal / log base)
    let mutable min_d = base * base * multiplier
    let mutable closest = 0.0
    let mutable min_n = base * base
  
    for multiple in multiples do
      let difference = abs(optimal - multiple * multiplier)
      if difference &lt; min_d then
	min_d &lt;- difference
	closest &lt;- multiple * multiplier
      if multiple &lt; min_n then min_n &lt;- multiple
  
    if abs(optimal - min_n * base * multiplier) &lt;  abs(optimal - closest) then
      min_n * base * multiplier
    else
      closest;;
val closest : #seq&lt;float&gt; -&gt; float -&gt; float -&gt; float</PRE>
      <P>For the common case of decimal, we supply the multiples 1, 2 and 5 and 
      the base 10:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let closest10 = closest [1.; 2.; 5.] 10.;;
val closest10 : (float -&gt; float)</PRE>
      <P>Alternatives including base 12 for months of the year and multiples of 
      pi for trigonometric functions.</P>
      <P>This function is easily tested in the interactive session:</P>
<PRE>&gt; List.map closest10 [0.123; 0.234; 0.456];
val it : float list = [0.1; 0.2; 0.5]</PRE>
      <P>The following function spreads roughly              <CODE>n</CODE> 
      ticks uniformly within the range from              <CODE>x0</CODE> to      
              <CODE>x1</CODE> at esthetic positions:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let ticks_of_range n x0 x1 =
    let d = (x1 - x0) / float(n - 1) |&gt; closest10
    let x0 = ceil(x0 / d) * d
    let x1 = floor(x1 / d) * d
    interp (int((x1 - x0) / d + 0.5) + 1) x0 x1;;
val ticks_of_range : int -&gt; float -&gt; float -&gt; seq&lt;float&gt;</PRE>
      <P>This              <CODE>ticks_of_range</CODE> function will be used to 
      generate tick coordinates spread across both axes.           </P>
      <H2>Drawing the axes and curve</H2>
      <P>In WPF, the style used to stroke a path is encapsulated in the          
          <CODE>Pen</CODE> class and the style used to fill the stroke 
      (typically a flat color) can be obtained from the              
      <CODE>Brushes</CODE> class.           </P>
      <P>We now stumble upon the first major pitfall that awaits the F# 
      programmer using WPF. A seasoned F# programmer would expect fills, strokes 
      and even entire scene graphs to be represented by simple values and, 
      consequently, be easy to use and, in particular, have no thread-related 
      intricacies. However, the current WPF implementation silently ties each 
      construction of the              <CODE>Pen</CODE> class to the thread that 
      it was created on and crashes programs with errors at run-time if a        
            <CODE>Pen</CODE> defined on one thread is accidentially referred to 
      from another thread.           </P>
      <P>Consequently, it is critically important that the construction of the 
      WPF              <CODE>Pen</CODE> class is deferred so that objects of 
      this class are only constructed as the scene graph is defined on the 
      rendering thread. This is a very subtle difference in terms of the F# code 
      required and is easily overlooked. More importantly, thread-related 
      accidents often culminate in obscure and undocumented error messages that 
      point to irrelevant code, such as the following:           </P>

                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>This error message can be obtained by the seemingly innocuous 
      definition of a              <CODE>Pen</CODE> (e.g. representing a white 
      3-pixel wide stroke) on the main thread:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let my_pen = Pen(Brushes.White, 3.0)   // DANGER!!!;;
val my_pen : Pen</PRE>
      <P>and then trying to use this pen on a separate rendering thread spawned 
      from an F# interactive session.</P>
      <P>Note that these thread related issues are entirely incidental 
      complexity created by the designers of WPF. There is no logical reason for 
      values representing styles, such as objects of the              
      <CODE>Pen</CODE> class, to be tied to a thread. Indeed, pushing such 
      complexity into even the simplest constructs in a library stifles 
      performance by preventing the user and compiler from performing many 
      effective high-level optimizations such as automatically hoisting constant 
      values and hash consing allocations.           </P>
      <P>An idiomatic functional solution would use entirely immutable data 
      structures to compose such values and the result would be trivially 
      thread-safe as a consequence and, therefore, rendering-related threading 
      issues really would be irrelevant for users. Like many graphical 
      applications, this is actually an excellent example where the use of a 
      functional style and, in particular, immutable data structures would make 
      programs much more concise, efficient and reliable.</P>
      <P>Consequently, we parameterize all drawing functions over all of the WPF 
      values they use including objects of the              <CODE>Pen</CODE> 
      class. The following functions draws a tick on the horizontal and vertical 
      axes, respectively:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let delta = 3.;;
val delta : float</PRE>
<PRE>&gt; let htick pen (x, y) v (dc : DrawingContext) =
    let text = sprintf "%.3g" v |&gt; text
    dc.DrawGeometry(null, pen, line false ((x, y + delta), [x, y]))
    dc.DrawText(text, Point(x - text.Width / 2.0, y + 3. * delta));;
val htick : Pen -&gt; float * float -&gt; float -&gt; DrawingContext -&gt; unit</PRE>
<PRE>&gt; let vtick pen (x, y) v (dc : DrawingContext) =
    let text = sprintf "%.3g" v |&gt; text
    dc.DrawGeometry(null, pen, line false ((x - delta, y), [x, y]))
    dc.DrawText(text, Point(x - 3. * delta - text.Width, y - text.Height / 2.0));;
val vtick : Pen -&gt; float * float -&gt; float -&gt; DrawingContext -&gt; unit</PRE>
      <P>These are our first functions to use a WPF              
      <CODE>DrawingContext</CODE> : a stateful object that captures 
      immediate-mode rendering commands. In other words, you create a            
        <CODE>DrawingContext</CODE> for a              <CODE>Visual</CODE> and 
      call members such as              <CODE>DrawGeometry</CODE> and            
        <CODE>DrawText</CODE> to dictate what should be drawn before using the   
                 <CODE>Visual</CODE> for rendering, e.g. by passing it to our    
                <CODE>VisualWindow</CODE> constructor defined above. This is the 
      essence of WPF's programmatic interface for rendering.           </P>
      <P>An idiomatic functional alternative would declaratively compose a 
      single data structure representing the scene and pass this for rendering. 
      An advantage of impure functional programming languages like F# is that 
      the distinction between the heavily imperative immediate-mode rendering 
      and the purely-functional declarative approach can be blurred by treating 
      the functions that draw pieces of scene as values, declaratively composing 
      such functions into a data structure that conveys the same information and 
      combines the benefits of both styles. However, it is still essential to 
      parameterize these functions over all WPF values to avoid the 
      thread-related problems discussed earlier.</P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>draw_axes</CODE> function draws two 
      lines and all of the ticks on both the horizontal and vertical axes, again 
      using the specified              <CODE>pen</CODE> line style:

      <P>The              <CODE>x_axis</CODE> and

         <I>x</I> coordinates of the              <I>x</I> - and              
      <I>y</I> -axes, respectively. If the axes lie off the graph then they are 
      placed at the extremity of the graph.           </P>
      <P>Two calls to              <CODE>DrawGeometry</CODE> are used to draw 
      the two axes. The open              <CODE>PathGeometry</CODE> geometries 
      of each line are created using the              <CODE>line</CODE> 
      function. List literals allows the end points to be specified concisely in 
      the source code.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>htick</CODE> and              <CODE>vtick</CODE> 
      functions are used to draw the ticks and labels on the axes.           
</P>
      <P>This              <CODE>draw_axes</CODE> function will produce a

      <P>The following              <CODE>draw_curve</CODE> function draws a

      <H2>Creating pens safely</H2>
      <P>The following function can be used to create objects of the

      <P>The              <CODE>brush</CODE> passed to this              
      <CODE>pen</CODE> function describes the style used to fill the stroke, 
      typically a flat color.           </P>
      <P>Note that this              <CODE>pen</CODE> function is never called 
      from the main thread: only from the rendering thread that is spawned later

      <H2>Clipping</H2>
      <P>The following higher-order              <CODE>clip</CODE> function 
      pushes a clip region onto the              <CODE>DrawingContext</CODE> for

      <H2>Interactive graph plotting</H2>
      <P>The              <CODE>graph</CODE> function can already be used to 
      fill a              <CODE>Visual</CODE> with a graph before feeding the    
                <CODE>Visual</CODE> to the              
      <CODE>VisualWindow</CODE> contructor to create a single-threaded 
      visualization. However, spawning a graph from an interactive session 
      without blocking the session which the GUI runs requires the WPF 
      application to be spawned on a new thread.           </P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>plot</CODE> function wraps this 
      functionality, allowing graphs to be spawned interactively as well as from 
      compiled programs:           </P>

      <P>This function spawns a separate thread in single-threaded apartment 
      state for the visualization. This new thread creates a new WPF application 
      context              <CODE>app</CODE> and then creates a new              
      <CODE>VisualWindow</CODE> in this application before calling the           
         <CODE>Run</CODE> member of the application to run the GUI application 
      until it is completes (i.e. until it is closed).           </P>
      <H2>Example use</H2>
      <P>This graph plotter is very easy to use from an F# interactive 
      session:</P>
