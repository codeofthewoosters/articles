      <H1>Force-based network visualization</H1>
      <P>Visualizing a graph or network of interconnected nodes is a fascinating 
      and important challenge with a wide variety of practical applications. 
      This article looks at a simple but effective force-based approach to the 
      visualization of networks and uses Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) 
      to display the results in real-time as they emerge. The result is a 
      compelling interactive animation of the layout algorithm as it 
      progresses.</P>
      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P>A graph or network is a set of nodes connected by edges. Networks 
      appear in many forms such as road networks, links between web pages, atoms 
      bonded in a molecule, social networks and so on. In many cases, the 
      ability to visualize such a network is extremely valuable. Such 
      visualizations are usually topological, i.e. a visualization of the 
      network of bonds in a molecule is unlikely to portray the 
      three-dimensional structure of the molecule accurately.</P>
      <P>This article uses a dynamical approach to network visualization by 
      modelling a soft-core repulsion to push nodes apart with an extra 
      attractive force to pull linked nodes together. The ratio of the forces is 
      controllable, allowing the user to determine how strongly the network 
      topology dictates the resulting structure.</P>
      <P>The ability to write word-sized values, specifically a reference to an 
      array, is exploited to allow the UI thread to take a snapshot of the state 
      of the visualization without requiring any synchronization.</P>
      <H2>Implementation</H2>
      <P>We begin by referencing the DLLs required to use Windows Presentation 
      Foundation:</P>
<PRE>&gt; #r "PresentationCore.dll";;</PRE>
<PRE>--&gt; Referenced 'C:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\
Framework\v3.0\PresentationCore.dll'</PRE>
<PRE>&gt; #r "PresentationFramework.dll";;</PRE>
<PRE>--&gt; Referenced 'C:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\
Framework\v3.0\PresentationFramework.dll'</PRE>
<PRE>&gt; #r "WindowsBase.dll";;</PRE>
<PRE>--&gt; Referenced 'C:\Program Files\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\
Framework\v3.0\WindowsBase.dll'</PRE>
      <P>We open the following namespaces for the UI code:</P>
<PRE>&gt; open System.Windows;;</PRE>
<PRE>&gt; open System.Windows.Media;;</PRE>
      <P>In this case, we shall visualize a network containing a fixed number of 
      nodes but, in practice, the network could be obtained from anywhere (e.g. 
      a web crawler):</P>
<PRE>&gt; let mutable nodes =
    let n = 200
    let rand = System.Random()
    [|for i in 0..n-1 -&gt;
        let t = float i / float n * 2.0 * System.Math.PI
        50.0 * Vector(1.0 + cos t, 1.0 + sin t)|];;
val mutable nodes : Vector array =
  [|100,50; 99.9753280182866,51.5705379539064;
    99.9013364214136,53.1395259764657; 99.778098230154,54.7054156659257;
    99.6057350657239,56.2666616782152; 99.3844170297569,57.8217232520115;
    ...|]</PRE>
      <P>The edges linked nodes together are represented by a matrix of booleans 
      that, in this case, we shall initialize randomly:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let edges =
    let n = nodes.Length
    let edges = Array2D.create n n false
    let rand = System.Random()
    for i in 1..n-1 do
      let j = rand.Next(i-1)
      edges.[i, j] &lt;- true
      edges.[j, i] &lt;- true
    edges;;
val edges : bool [,] =
  [[false; true; true; false; true; false; false; false; false; false; false;
    false; false; true; false; false; false; false; false; false; false; false;
    false; false; false; true; false; false; false; false; false; false; false;
   ...]</PRE>
      <P>WPF provides a              <CODE>Rect</CODE>  structure that can be 
      used to represent a rectangle and can be updated to include new points 
      using the              <CODE>Union</CODE> member, and the              
      <CODE>Viewbox</CODE> control can be used to stretch content to fill the 
      available space. However, the underlying              <CODE>Rect</CODE> 
      structure is incapable of representing an empty area so it always includes 
      the origin by default and, consequently, the              
      <CODE>Viewbox</CODE> control always makes the origin visible even if the 
      content is nowhere near the origin. Thus, we shall use our own             
       <CODE>bound</CODE> function to compute the bound of a set of points 
      without including the origin:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let bound (rs: Vector []) =
    let mutable x0 = infinity
    let mutable y0 = infinity
    let mutable x1 = -infinity
    let mutable y1 = -infinity
    for r in rs do
      x0 &lt;- min x0 r.X
      y0 &lt;- min y0 r.Y
      x1 &lt;- max x1 r.X
      y1 &lt;- max y1 r.Y
    x0, y0, x1, y1;;
val bound : Vector [] -&gt; float * float * float * float</PRE>
      <P>The following              <CODE>ratio</CODE> is a mutable reference to 
      a              <CODE>float</CODE> that can be adjusted by the user (to 
      control the influence of the topology on the visualization):           
</P>
<PRE>&gt; let ratio = ref 0.0;;
val ratio : float ref = {contents = 0.0;}</PRE>
      <P>Note that we require the ability to update this value atomically so we 
      use a mutable reference via              <CODE>ref</CODE> because a 
      reference is a single word and can be updated atomically. In contrast, 
      marking the              <CODE>ratio</CODE> variable as              
      <CODE>mutable</CODE> would allow the 64-bit              
      <CODE>float</CODE> value to be modified in-place which would not be atomic 
      and, therefore, the worker thread might read a half-written value.         
        </P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>work</CODE> function will be applied 
      on a background worker thread:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let work () =
    while true do
      let n = nodes.Length
      let forces = Array.create nodes.Length (Vector(0., 0.))
      for i=0 to n-2 do
        for j=i+1 to n-1 do
          let p1, p2 = nodes.[i], nodes.[j]
          let d = p2 - p1
          let s = d.Length
          let is = 100.0 / s
          let f = is * is - 2.0 * is
          let bond s = exp(!ratio * s)
          let f = f + if edges.[i,j] then -bond s else 0.0
          let d = f * d

val work : unit -&gt; unit</PRE>
      <P>This function loops indefinitely, computing and applying forces to push 
      the nodes around.</P>
      <P>Two nested loops are used to apply forces between every pair of nodes. 
      A soft-core force is applied to all pairs, to settle them into a 
      configuration with uniformly-separated nearest neighbors. A attractive 
      force that grows exponentially with the separation is applied between all 
      linked nodes to pull them together.</P>
      <P>The maximum force on any node is computed and used the scale the other 
      forces to ensure that each step is sufficiently small, producing an 
      attractive animation and improving numerical robustness.</P>
      <P>Finally, a new              <CODE>nodes</CODE> array is computed and 
      written over the old array. Note that this is writing a single word-sized 
      pointer and, therefore, is an atomic operation. Thus, the UI thread will 
      be able to atomically read the global              <CODE>nodes</CODE> 
      safely.           </P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>size</CODE> value is used to set the 
      size of the nodes and thickness of the edges when drawn:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let size = 1.0;;
val size : float = 1.0</PRE>
      <P>Both the ellipses used to draw the nodes and lines used to draw the 
      edges will require the same set of styles so we introduce the following    
                <CODE>style</CODE> function to set the style of any subtype of   
                 <CODE>Shapes.Shape</CODE> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let style (shape: Shapes.Shape) =

    shape.StrokeThickness &lt;- size / 8.0
    shape.Fill &lt;- Brushes.Red
    shape;;
val style : Shapes.Shape -&gt; Shapes.Shape</PRE>
      <P>The following              <CODE>line</CODE> function creates a         
           <CODE>Shape</CODE> that is a single straight line between two points: 
                </P>
<PRE>&gt; let line x1 y1 x2 y2 =
    Shapes.Line(X1=x1, Y1=y1, X2=x2, Y2=y2)
    |&gt; style;;
val line : float -&gt; float -&gt; float -&gt; float -&gt; Shapes.Shape</PRE>
      <P>The following              <CODE>viz</CODE> function updates the 
      visualization by taking a snapshot of the nodes and generating a           
         <CODE>Canvas</CODE> containing lines and circles:           </P>

      <P>A new              <CODE>Canvas</CODE> is constructed and filled each 
      time this function is invoked. Although this is wasteful, this function 
      will only be called every screen refresh.           </P>
      <P>The seemingly-redundant              <CODE>let nodes = nodes</CODE> 
      creates a local variable from the global              <CODE>nodes</CODE> 
      variable. This has the effect of copying the array by reference and is an 
      atomic operation because reference types occupy a single word. Thus, this 
      creates a local reference to a snapshot of the nodes that can then be read 
      safely without having to worry about the worker thread concurrently 
      updating the elements of the array.           </P>
      <P>A pair of nested loops detect linked nodes and adds lines to the canvas 
      representing the edges between them. A single loop then adds a circle to 
      the canvas for each node. Finally, the              <CODE>Child</CODE> 
      property of the              <CODE>Viewbox</CODE> is set to the new

      initializes the GUI elements, registers a callback to the              
      <CODE>viz</CODE> function to update the canvas every screen refresh and

      <H2>Results</H2>
      <P>When run, the program described above creates a window with a slider 
      and a real-time visualization. The nodes are initially laid out around a 
      circle and gradually settle into circular formation according to the 
      attractive and repulsive default pair potential:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Force-based%20network%20visualization_files/circular.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>Dragging the slider to the right introduces progressively stronger 
      attractive forces between linked nodes. Once settled with the slider at 
      maximum, we obtain a spikey layout where the dominant force is the 
      attraction between linked nodes:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Force-based%20network%20visualization_files/pointy.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>This layout is dictated primarily by the topology of the network but 
      there is a trade-off between this and the improved clarity of a uniform 
      representation. Thus, dragging the slider partway back allows the user to 
      control the spread of the nodes and an esthetic compromise can be 
      reached:</P>

      <H2>Summary</H2>
      <P>This article used a simple dynamical simulation of nodes interacting 
      via pair potentials to create controllable visualizations of arbitrary 
      networks. The results show that this simple program can be used to 
      visualize quite complicated networks.</P>
      <P>Future F#.NET Journal articles will revisit the subject real-time 
      interactive visualization.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
