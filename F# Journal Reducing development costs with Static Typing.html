      <H1>Reducing development costs with Static Typing</H1>
      <P>The F# language arms programmers with the most sophisticated static 
      type system of any mainstream programming language. This static type 
      system can be used to remove large classes of common bugs that are 
      otherwise tedious or impossible to track down, drastically reducing 
      software development costs. However, learning how and when to leverage 
      such a type system is an art that requires significant effort to learn. 
      This article describes idiomatic F# style and a variety of techniques that 
      can be used to leverage the static type system in order to catch errors 
      earlier and more easily.</P>
      <H2>Classic structure of an ML program</H2>
      <P>The ML family of languages is now well over three decades old and the 
      basic structure of an ML program has become widely accepted: programs are 
      broken down into many small type definitions and many small functions that 
      act upon them. A strong correlation between types and functions is to be 
      expected and, in many cases, related type and value definitions are 
      encapsulated into modules. Auxiliary functions are often written 
      independently (as opposed to being nested) and are then hidden by a module 
      signature to shadow them from users.</P>
      <P>The following "expr.fs" file demonstrates many of these points:</P>
<PRE>#light</PRE>
<PRE>module Expr</PRE>
<PRE>type t =
  | Int of int
  | Var of string
  | Add of t * t
  | Mul of t * t</PRE>
<PRE>let rec print ff = function
  | Int n -&gt; fprintf ff "%d" n
  | Var var -&gt; fprintf ff "%s" var
  | Add(f, g) -&gt; fprintf ff "%a + %a" print f print g
  | Mul(f, g) -&gt; fprintf ff "%a %a" print_prod f print_prod g
and print_prod ff = function
  | Add _ as f -&gt; fprintf ff "(%a)" print f
  | f -&gt; print ff f
and prints sep ff = function
  | [] -&gt; ()
  | [h] -&gt; print ff h
  | h::t -&gt; fprintf ff "%a%s%a" print h sep (prints sep) t</PRE>
      <P>Along with the related "expr.fsi" module signature file:</P>
<PRE>#light</PRE>
<PRE>module Expr</PRE>
<PRE>open System.IO</PRE>
<PRE>type t =
  | Int of int
  | Var of string
  | private Add of t * t
  | private Mul of t * t</PRE>
<PRE>val print : TextWriter -&gt; t -&gt; unit
val prints : string -&gt; TextWriter -&gt; t list -&gt; unit</PRE>
      <P>Note the following characteristics of this module:</P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>The                  <CODE>Expr</CODE> module encapsulates 
        definitions related to symbolic expressions, including the variant type  
                        <CODE>Expr.t</CODE> used to represent symbolic 
        expressions and functions for printing expressions and lists of 
        expressions.               </LI>
        <LI>The signature of the                  <CODE>Expr</CODE> module acts 
        as machine-verified documentation for the module. Errors in development 
        that result in different types being inferred for definitions exposed by 
        the                  <CODE>Expr</CODE> module will be caught at compile 
        time by the static type checker due to inconsistency with this 
        signature.               </LI>
        <LI>Both the                  <CODE>print</CODE> and                  
        <CODE>prints</CODE> functions are exposed even though the former can be 
        trivially derived from the latter in user code.               </LI>
        <LI>The auxiliary                  <CODE>print_prod</CODE> function, for 
        bracketing subexpressions in a product, is written as a top-level 
        function within the module and then hidden by the module's signature.    
                   </LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>In the absence of a static type checker to catch errors (i.e. in a 
      dynamic language) one might only expose the              
      <CODE>prints</CODE>  function and pass it a singleton list and an empty 
      separator when printing a single expression rather than bloating the API 
      with the trivially-specialized              <CODE>print</CODE> function. 
      However, using the more specific              <CODE>print</CODE> function 
      conveys more information to the static type checker which, in turn, can 
      catch more bugs and remove more run-time tests. In this sense, the type    
                <CODE>Expr.t</CODE> is a more accurate or              
      <I>constrained</I> representation of a singleton list than the type        
            <CODE>Expr.t list</CODE> . Using more constrained types conveys more 
      specific information to the static type checker that will then perform 
      more useful checks on the code. Learning how best to convey type 
      information is the essence of leveraging a static type system.           
      </P>
      <P>As we shall see in the remainder of this article, F#'s static type 
      system allows more sophisticated constraints to be conveyed to the type 
      system and checked for correctness than this example has shown. The 
      objective of leveraging the static type system is always to use the 
      compiler to prove that important potential sources of error have been 
      removed. The consequence is a greatly reduced need for unit testing and 
      much faster development speed.</P>
      <H2>Statically-known lengths</H2>
      <P>The previous example explained how lists should be removed when they 
      are expected to only ever contain a single element. Similarly, F#'s type 
      system can represent fixed-length sequences and sequences that must have 
      at least a minimum number of elements.</P>
      <H3>Fixed lengths</H3>
      <P>In the absence of a static type system, a function with two arguments 
      might accept a list of arguments and raise an error if the number of 
      arguments (i.e. the length of the list) is not two:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let f = function
    | [x; y] -&gt; atan2 x y
    | _ -&gt; invalid_arg "f";;
val f : float list -&gt; float</PRE>
      <P>Provided the correct number of arguments is conveyed to this function, 
      this dynamic style of programming only results in slow execution due to 
      the unnecessary overhead of using a list:</P>
<PRE>&gt; f [2.; 3.];;
val it : float = 0.5880026035</PRE>
      <P>However, a call site that erroneously supplies this              
      <CODE>f</CODE> function with the wrong number of arguments results in a 
      run-time error, an exception:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; f [];;
Microsoft.FSharp.Core.InvalidArgumentException: f
   at FSI_0019.f(List`1 _arg5)
   at &lt;StartupCode$FSI_0021&gt;.FSI_0021._main()
stopped due to error</PRE>
      <P>Note that such sources of run-time error are typically explicit in the 
      code (as is the case here).</P>
      <P>This source of run-time errors is easily removed using static type 
      checking by writing              <CODE>f</CODE> as a function of two 
      arguments, either as a 2-tuple or in curried form:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let f(x, y) = atan2 x y;;
val f : float * float -&gt; float</PRE>
      <P>Attempting to supply zero arguments to              <CODE>f</CODE> 
      results in a type error that is caught at compile-time rather than at 
      run-time:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; f();;
stdin(13,1): error: FS0001: This expression has type
	unit
but is here used with type
	float * float
stopped due to error</PRE>
      <P>A common situation where lists are sometimes used to pass variable 
      numbers of arguments in dynamic programming languages like Mathematica is 
      solved in F# using a different language feature: optional arguments. This 
      topic will be covered in detail in a future F#.NET Journal article.</P>
      <H2>Minimum lengths</H2>
      <P>Programs often manipulate sequences (such as lists) that are known to 
      have at least one element, i.e. they should never be empty. Although the 
      ordinary              <CODE>list</CODE> type can be used in this 
      situation, that type's ability to represent an empty list culminates in 
      unwanted sources of run-time error.           </P>
      <P>Consider the              <CODE>List.fold1_left</CODE> function that 
      applies a given operator between the elements of a list. These semantics 
      mean that this function does not need a base case for the accumulator and 
      fails on the empty sequence. A straightforward implementation of this 
      function might be:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec fold1_left f = function
    | h::t -&gt; List.fold_left f h t
    | [] -&gt; invalid_arg "fold1_left";;
val reduce : ('a -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'a</PRE>
      <P>If this function were used as-is in production code then it would 
      perpetually be a potential source of run-time errors. This is never 
      desirable and the static type system can be used to remove that run-time 
      error safe in the knowledge that it has been proven redundant (i.e. can 
      never be executed) by the F# compiler.</P>
      <P>The F# type system allows us to migrate from using the              
      <CODE>list</CODE> type to a very similar but subtly different data 
      structure that is unable to represent the empty sequence and, 
      consequently, allows us to statically enforce the requirement that 
      sequences have at least one element. The type is the pair or 2-tuple       
             <CODE>'a * 'a list</CODE> where the first element of the pair 
      represents the head of the sequence and the second element represents the 
      tail.           </P>
      <P>Reusing the existing              <CODE>list</CODE> type is easiest but 
      our new type (say              <CODE>list1</CODE> ) could also be declared 
      independently using a variant type such as the following:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; type 'a list1 =
    | End of 'a
    | Cons of 'a * 'a list1;;</PRE>
      <P>Note that there is no representation of the empty sequence in this type 
      either.</P>
      <P>As an educational exercise, let us migrate to the more expressively 
      typed pair-based implementation with an intermediate step. The             
       <CODE>fold1_left</CODE> function may be rewritten as follows:           
      </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec fold1_left f = function
    | h, t -&gt; List.fold_left f h t
    | _ -&gt; invalid_arg "List.fold1_left";;
file1.fs(44,6): warning: FS0026: This rule will never be matched.
val reduce : ('a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a * 'b list -&gt; 'a</PRE>
      <P>Note how the F# compiler has determined that the match case containing 
      the run-time error is redundant because the first pattern (over the 
      2-tuple) now covers every possible value of this type. This is a direct 
      result of the 2-tuple representation requiring the existence of both a 
      head and a tail for the sequence and, therefore, any value of this type is 
      guaranteed to represent a sequence of one or more elements.</P>
      <P>This implementation of the              <CODE>fold1_left</CODE> 
      function can now be written more simply without the match case that had a 
      run-time error:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let reduce f (h, t) =
    List.fold_left f h t;;
val reduce : ('a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a * 'b list -&gt; 'a</PRE>
      <P>Altering the type and, therefore, the data structure used by this 
      function has allowed the potential source of run-time errors to be made 
      redundant and safely removed from the program.</P>
      <P>Choosing a data structure to enforce a minimum length for a sequence in 
      this way is a common design pattern. Indeed, the              
      <CODE>Add</CODE> and              <CODE>Mul</CODE> constructors in our 
      first symbolic expression example both require exactly two arguments. This 
      might seem mundane but it means that subsequent code never has to handle 
      the cases of additions or multiplications with zero or one arguments. In 
      contrast, Mathematica must handle these cases as any number of arguments 
      can be passed to any function in Mathematica because it provides no static 
      assurances.           </P>
      <H2>Aim to remove sources of run-time error</H2>
      <P>In the general case, production-quality programs contain a variety of 
      types that can often grow to be quite complicated. If run-time errors 
      become a problem then search the code for sources of run-time error, most 
      notably              <CODE>invalid_arg</CODE> exceptions, and try to 
      design alternate data structures that make the most problematic sources of 
      run-time error redundant.           </P>
      <P>Although powerful, F#'s type system cannot express all possible 
      constraints. Consequently, non-trivial programs will always contain 
      unwanted potential sources of run-time error. This is why the process of 
      eliminating the most worrisome sources of error is an art rather than a 
      science: the notion of "worrisome" cannot be quantified. Ultimately, the 
      ability to leverage a static type system effectively boils largely down to 
      experience.</P>
      <H2>Use abstraction to enforce incompatibility between types</H2>
      <P>Types are often aliased because new types can be represented as 
      existing types. For example, a type representing a Universally Unique 
      Identifier (UUID) might be stored internally as a string:</P>
<PRE>&gt; type uuid = string;;
type uuid = string</PRE>
      <P>However, the static type checker does not distinguish between this new  
                  <CODE>uuid</CODE> type and the original              
      <CODE>string</CODE> type. For example, we do not want it to be possible to 
      concatenate a value of the type              <CODE>string</CODE> with a 
      value of the type              <CODE>uuid</CODE> accidentally:           
      </P>
<PRE>&gt; ("foo" : string) + ("bar" : uuid);;
val it : string = "foobar"</PRE>
      <P>The distinction between these types can be conveyed to the static type 
      system by making the              <CODE>uuid</CODE> type abstract, by 
      naming but not defining its contents in the signature of its enclosing 
      module:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; module Uuid : sig
    type t
    val of_string : string -&gt; t
    val to_string : t -&gt; string
  end = struct
    type t = UUID of string
    let of_string s = UUID s
    let to_string (UUID s) = s
  end;;
module Uuid : begin
  type t = UUID of string
  val of_string : string -&gt; t
  val to_string : t -&gt; string
end</PRE>
      <P>Note how the abstract type requires functions inside its module to 
      construct and destruct values of this type because this cannot be done 
      from outside this module. Also, aliases to existing types such as          
          <CODE>string</CODE> cannot be made abstract directly in F# and the 
      type must be wrapped in a new type constructor (in this case the           
         <CODE>UUID</CODE> constructor).           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>Uuid.t</CODE> type is now regarded as being 
      distinct from the              <CODE>string</CODE> type even though the 
      values of these types share the same internal representation. So the 
      previous example using equality now gives a static type error as desired:  
               </P>
<PRE>&gt; ("foo" : string) + (Uuid.of_string "bar");;
stdin(2,20): error: FS0001: This expression has type
	Uuid.t
but is here used with type</PRE>
<PRE>	string
stopped due to error</PRE>
      <P>The ability to make types incompatible using abstraction is very common 
      and very useful.</P>
      <H2>Phantom types</H2>
      <P>A single type is sometimes used to represent different "kinds" of 
      values of that type. When this type is abstract, it is possible to 
      parameterize the type over a type variable that is never actually used. No 
      values of this "phantom" type ever exist and, in fact, this type is 
      completely removed from the program at compile-time. The sole purpose of 
      this phantom type is to introduce a distinction between different kinds of 
      the same type.</P>
      <P>The previous UUID example serves as an excellent case study. UUIDs can 
      be used to refer to many different kinds of entity. In the case of 
      virtualization, a UUID might refer to a physical host, or a logical host, 
      or a disk drive and so forth. However, we do not wish to reimplement the   
                 <CODE>Uuid</CODE> module for each and every kind of UUID. 
      Moreover, even if we did create many separate implementations to 
      distinguish between them, we could not write functions that act upon any 
      kind of UUID (such as a print function for all UUIDs).           </P>
      <P>Phantom types provide a concise and elegant solution to this problem. 
      The              <CODE>Uuid.t</CODE> type is simply parameterized over a 
      type variable:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; module Uuid : sig
    type 'a t
    val of_string : string -&gt; 'a t
    val to_string : 'a t -&gt; string
  end = struct
    type 'a t = UUID of string
    let of_string s = UUID s
    let to_string (UUID s) = s
  end;;
module Uuid : begin
  type 'a t = UUID of string
  val of_string : string -&gt; 'a t
  val to_string : 'a t -&gt; string
end</PRE>
      <P>This seemingly innocuous alteration allows us to tag any              
      <CODE>Uuid.t</CODE> type with another type that represents the kind of 
      UUID being referred to. For example, a new empty type              
      <CODE>disk</CODE> can be used to parameterize all UUIDs that reference 
      disks:           </P>
<PRE>&gt;  type disk = Dummy;;
type disk = Dummy
&gt; let disks : disk Uuid.t list = [];;
val disks : disk Uuid.t list = []</PRE>
      <P>This allows the same implementation of the              
      <CODE>Uuid.t</CODE> type to be used to handle both generic UUIDs (of the 
      type              <CODE>'a Uuid.t</CODE> ) and specific UUIDs.           
      </P>
      <H2>Do not overuse inferred types</H2>
      <P>Tuples are product types that do not need to be declared. The ability 
      to use these types without having to declare them first has many benefits 
      but overuse of this feature quickly becomes problematic. Bugs that slip 
      through the static type system due to the overuse of inferred types are 
      rare and, in practice, the more serious consequence is reduced clarity 
      that impedes development.</P>
      <P>Programmers learning F# often make the mistake of initially overusing 
      tuples and quickly learn that tuples with four or more elements are 
      generally more trouble than they are worth and that the solution is to use 
      a record type because its explicitly-named fields help enormously to 
      disambiguate between the elements of the product type.</P>
      <P>The same principle applies to variant type constructors that take many 
      arguments. Consider a type representing a subroutine or function in a 
      Fortran 77 program:</P>
<PRE>type subprogram =
  | Subroutine of string * (string * Type.t) list * (string * (Type.t * Expr.t)) list * stmt list
  | Function of string * (string * Type.t) list * (string * (Type.t * Expr.t)) list * stmt list * Type.t</PRE>
      <P>These              <CODE>Subroutine</CODE> and              
      <CODE>Function</CODE> type constructors clearly have a lot in common. 
      Specifically, they both declare the subprogram name and the name and type 
      of each argument, the name, type and value of each local variable and then 
      the body of the subprogram as a list of statements. The only difference is 
      that the              <CODE>Function</CODE> constructor represents a 
      Fortran 77 function that returns a value and, consequently, also has a 
      return type.           </P>
      <P>This can be refactored into a much more comprehensible form as a 
      record, using an optional return type to distinguish between a subroutine 
      and a function. In this case, the record completely replaces the sum 
      type:</P>
<PRE>type subprogram =
  {
    name: string;
    args: (string * Type.t) list;
    locals: (string * (Type.t * Expr.t)) list;
    body: stmt list;
    ret: Type.t option
  }</PRE>
      <P>The following illustrates the correspondance between values of the old 
      and new types:</P>
<PRE>Subroutine("foo", ["X", Type.Real; "Y", Type.Real], ["Z", Type.Complex], [...])</PRE>
<PRE>{name="foo"; args=["X", Type.Real; "Y", Type.Real]; locals=["Z", Type.Complex], body=[...]; ret=None}</PRE>
      <P>The use of a record type with named fields here leads to much more 
      comprehensible error messages compared to a 5-tuple.</P>
      <H2>Avoid dynamic typing</H2>
      <P>Dynamic typing can be achieved in F# by casting all types up to the 
      base              <CODE>obj</CODE> type. This can be done using the 
      built-in              <CODE>box</CODE> function:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; box 3;;
val it : obj = 3</PRE>
      <P>This loses all static type information and, consequently, functions 
      that use this style are highly susceptible to run-time errors.</P>
      <P>Dynamic typing can be essential in interface code. However, this is 
      typically only because existing .NET libraries have resorted to 
      dynamically typed style rather than exposing a more appropriate class 
      hierarchy. Excel interoperability is one such area, where all values are 
      exchanged using the              <CODE>obj</CODE> type even though Excel 
      can only handle a tiny number of types that could have been expressed more 
      specifically using a suitable class hierarchy (analogous to an F# variant 
      type).           </P>
      <P>As a rule of thumb, transform all dynamically-typed values into 
      statically typed values as soon as possible when dealing with interfaces. 
      In other words, avoid trying to manipulate data structures that contain 
      values of the type              <CODE>obj</CODE> in F# programs.           
      </P>
      <P>Another related language feature is the dynamic type test              
      <CODE>:?</CODE> that can be used in pattern matches to distinguish between 
      different subtypes at run-time. This is of particular use when handling 
      exceptions propagated from non-F# libraries on .NET. However, this 
      function has no place in self-contained F# code.           </P>
      <H2>Avoid over-generalizations</H2>
      <P>The ML and Haskell languages provide a feature known as              
      <I>automatic generalization</I> by inferring the most general possible 
      type. This is almost always extremely productive. There is very rarely any 
      need to annotate function definitions by hand with information such as 
      type variables and type constraints, as you must using forms of parametric 
      polymorphism such as C++ templates or generics in C#. However, on rare 
      occasions the inferred type can be more general than intended.           
      </P>
      <P>For example, the following implementation of the Kronecker delta 
      function is inferred to have a generic type due to the use of the 
      polymorphic              <CODE>=</CODE> operator:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let kronecker i j =
    if i=j then 1 else 0;;
val kronecker : 'a -&gt; 'a -&gt; int</PRE>
      <P>The arguments were intended to be of the type              
      <CODE>int</CODE> , so a type annotation can be used to constrain the type 
      and applications of this              <CODE>kronecker</CODE> function will 
      benefit from more rigorous type checking:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let kronecker (i : int) j =
    if i=j then 1 else 0;;
val kronecker : int -&gt; int -&gt; int</PRE>
      <P>Over-generalization of types is not unusual but is rarely a source of 
      bugs.</P>
      <H2>Summary</H2>
      <P>This article has described a variety of different ways that F#'s 
      powerful static type system can be used effectively in order to catch 
      important classes of bugs that are otherwise a sink for time and money 
      during development.</P>
      <P>In addition to the basic techniques covered in this article, the 
      integration of object oriented and functional programming paradigms paves 
      the way for a new breed of structured programming, going beyond almost all 
      existing design patterns. The structuring of significant programs in F# is 
      a substantially more involved topic and will be introduced in future 
      F#.NET Journal articles.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
