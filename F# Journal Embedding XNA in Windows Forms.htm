      <H1>Embedding XNA in Windows Forms</H1>
      <P>Microsoft's XNA library is conventionally used for whole-screen games 
      programming but related GUI applications such as level editors can often 
      benefit from the ability to reuse the same XNA-based rendering code in a 
      Windows Forms application. This article describes how an XNA-based Windows 
      Forms control can be written in F#, allowing XNA to be used in an ordinary 
      Windows application.</P>
      <H2>XNA</H2>
      <P>Microsoft's XNA tool set was first introduced in 2004 and is a 
      high-level managed interface built upon the Common Language Runtime that 
      is designed specifically for computer game development. XNA runs on 
      Windows XP, Windows Vista and the Xbox 360.</P>
      <P>Although XNA was designed specifically for games programming, it is 
      also the most appropriate graphics API available under Windows for any 
      applications requiring any advanced graphical features such a per-pixel 
      lighting and shadows. Windows Presentation Foundation is an alternative 
      graphics API, providing an extensive GUI toolkit but lacking advanced 
      features such as per-pixel lighting and hardware support for shadows. 
      Managed DirectX was the predecessor of XNA and WPF and is no longer being 
      maintained by Microsoft. OpenGL is another possibility and, although it is 
      not supported by Microsoft, OpenGL is still heavily used under Windows. A 
      future F#.NET Journal article will cover the use of OpenGL from F# in 
      detail.</P>
      <P>As XNA was designed specifically for games programming, its default 
      mode of use is to take over the whole screen or window in order to provide 
      an immersive gaming experience. However, as XNA is now the only 
      actively-maintained graphics library able to exploit the full capabilities 
      of the graphics hardware, it is often desirable to be able to embed 
      XNA-based renderings into Windows Forms applications. This can be achieved 
      using a little-known technique to create an XNA Windows Forms control.</P>
      <P>This article describes how an XNA Windows Forms control can be 
      implemented in F#. For a linguistic perspective, this is particularly 
      interesting because it leverages F#'s object-oriented capabilities and 
      requires interperability with native .NET events.</P>
      <H2>XNA Control</H2>
      <P>This program is written entirely in the              
      <CODE>#light</CODE> syntax option:           </P>
<PRE>#light</PRE>
      <P>The              <CODE>Microsoft.Xna.Framework.dll</CODE> and           
         <CODE>Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game.dll</CODE> DLLs are required:        
         </P>

      <P>In the interests of clarity, the following namespaces are opened:</P>
<PRE>&gt; open System;;
&gt; open System.Windows.Forms;;
&gt; open Microsoft.Xna.Framework;;</PRE>
      <P>The presentation parameters are required when creating and resetting 
      the display device so we factor them out into a separate function:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let presentation_parameters width height =
    let pp = new Graphics.PresentationParameters()
    pp.IsFullScreen &lt;- false
    pp.BackBufferCount &lt;- 1
    pp.BackBufferHeight &lt;- height
    pp.BackBufferWidth &lt;- width
    pp;;
val presentation_parameters : int -&gt; int -&gt; Graphics.PresentationParameters</PRE>
      <P>These are equivalent to              <CODE>PresentParameters</CODE> in 
      DirectX.           </P>
      <H2>The graphics device service and graphics device manager</H2>
      <P>Using Xna in a Windows Forms control requires a graphics device service 
      implementing the              <CODE>IGraphicsDeviceService</CODE> and      
              <CODE>IGraphicsDeviceManager</CODE> interfaces. The former 
      interface requires several .NET-compatible events to be provided. In C#, 
      each event can be created using a single line of code but in F# this 
      currently requires slightly more work.           </P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>GraphicsDeviceService</CODE> class 
      implements both of these interfaces:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; type GraphicsDeviceService(control : Control) as this =
    let mutable device : Graphics.GraphicsDevice = null
  
    let _, deviceDisposing = IEvent.create_DelegateEvent()
    let _, deviceReset = IEvent.create_DelegateEvent()
    let _, deviceResetting = IEvent.create_DelegateEvent()
    let _, deviceCreated = IEvent.create_DelegateEvent()
  
    do this.CreateDevice()
  
    member this.GraphicsDevice = device
  
    interface Graphics.IGraphicsDeviceService with
      member this.GraphicsDevice
	with get() = this.GraphicsDevice
  
      member this.remove_DeviceDisposing(f) = deviceDisposing.RemoveHandler(f)
      member this.add_DeviceDisposing(f) = deviceDisposing.AddHandler(f)

type GraphicsDeviceService = class
                             end
                             with
                               interface IGraphicsDeviceManager
                               interface Graphics.IGraphicsDeviceService
                               new : control:Control -&gt; GraphicsDeviceService
                               member CreateDevice : unit -&gt; unit
                               member GraphicsDevice : Graphics.GraphicsDevice
                             end</PRE>
      <P>This class definition has been given using an implicit constructor that 
      accepts a Windows Forms control called              <CODE>control</CODE> . 
      The four calls to              <CODE>IEvent.create_DelegateEvent()</CODE> 
      create four separate .NET-compatible events. The functions for adding and 
      removing event handlers for each of the four events are given in the 
      implementation of the              <CODE>IGraphicsDeviceService</CODE> 
      interface within this function.           </P>
      <P>Members implemented inside interfaces in class definitions are private, 
      so the call to the              <CODE>this.GraphicsDevice</CODE> property 
      inside the definition of the              <CODE>GraphicsDevice</CODE> 
      property of the              <CODE>IGraphicsDeviceService</CODE> interface 
      implementation is calling the public              
      <CODE>GraphicsDevice</CODE> property of the              
      <CODE>GraphicsDeviceService</CODE> class.           </P>
      <P>This              <CODE>GraphicsDeviceService</CODE> class also 
      implements the              <CODE>IGraphicsDeviceManager</CODE> interface 
      to provide device creation. Again, this calls out from the interface 
      implementation of the              <CODE>CreateDevice</CODE> member to the 
      public member of the same name.           </P>
      <H2>The Xna Control</H2>
      <P>The              <CODE>GraphicsDeviceService</CODE> class is used to 
      implement the following              <CODE>XnaControl</CODE> class that 
      represents a Windows Forms control that renders its contents using XNA:    
             </P>
<PRE>&gt; type XnaControl(draw) as this =
    inherit Control(Dock=DockStyle.Fill) as base
    
    let mutable graphicsDeviceService = lazy(new GraphicsDeviceService(this))
    
    override this.OnPaintBackground(e) = ()
    
    override this.OnPaint(e) =
      base.OnPaint e
      if this.Visible then
	let gds = Lazy.force graphicsDeviceService
	try
	  let device = gds.GraphicsDevice
	  match device.GraphicsDeviceStatus with
	  | Graphics.GraphicsDeviceStatus.Normal -&gt;
	      device.Clear(Graphics.Color.White)
	      draw this.Width this.Height device
	      device.Present()
	      this.Invalidate()
	  | Graphics.GraphicsDeviceStatus.NotReset -&gt;
	      device.Reset(presentation_parameters this.Width this.Height)
	  | _ -&gt; ()
	with _ -&gt;
	  gds.CreateDevice()
	  this.Invalidate()
  
    override this.OnResize(e) =
      base.OnResize e
      let device = (Lazy.force graphicsDeviceService).GraphicsDevice
      try
	device.Reset(presentation_parameters this.Width this.Height)
	this.Invalidate()
      with _ -&gt; ()
type XnaControl =
  class
    inherit Control
  end
  with
    new : draw:(int -&gt; int -&gt; Graphics.GraphicsDevice -&gt; unit) -&gt; XnaControl
  end</PRE>
      <P>This class uses a lazily constructed              
      <CODE>GraphicsDeviceService</CODE> object. This is a simpler and more 
      robust alternative to trying to ensure that all objects are created after 
      class construction but before use, e.g. via the              
      <CODE>OnLoad</CODE> member.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>OnPaint</CODE> member is overridden to check 
      that the control is visible (e.g. not minimized), force the lazy           
         <CODE>graphicsDeviceService</CODE> value (creating it or fetching the 
      previously created value) and either render the scene or reset the 
      graphics device depending upon its state. The scene is rendered 
      programmatically by the              <CODE>draw</CODE> function that was 
      passed to the              <CODE>XnaControl</CODE> constructor.           
      </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>OnResize</CODE> member is overridden to reset 
      the device (updating its resolution) and redraw the control whenever the 
      window is resized (rather than just when it grows, which is the default).  
               </P>
      <H2>Using the XNA Control</H2>
      <P>To demonstrate the functionality offered by the above code, here is a 
      simple example program that renders a spinning triangle in 3D.</P>
      <H3>Vertices</H3>
      <P>The triangle is defined by three vertices:</P>
<PRE>let triangle =
  let vertex c r = new Graphics.VertexPositionColor(r, c)
  [|
    vertex Graphics.Color.Red (Vector3(-1.f, -1.f, 0.f));
    vertex Graphics.Color.Green (Vector3(0.f, 1.f, 0.f));
    vertex Graphics.Color.Blue (Vector3(1.f, -1.f, 0.f));
  |];;
val triangle : Graphics.VertexPositionColor array</PRE>
      <P>Note the use of a nested              <CODE>vertex</CODE> function to 
      simplify the subsequent code and the absence of the              
      <CODE>new</CODE> keyword when constructing objects of the              
      <CODE>Vector3</CODE> class.           </P>
      <H3>An XNA Effect</H3>
      <P>XNA requires vertex and pixel shaders to be defined in a language 
      called              <I>HLSL</I> in order to define an              
      <I>effect</I> for rendering. The following defines the source code for a 
      vertex and pixel shader in HLSL as a string:           </P>

      <H2>Summary</H2>
      <P>This article has introduced the basic rendering functionality of the 
      XNA library from Microsoft and has demonstrated how XNA may be used to 
      embed high-performance graphics in Windows Forms applications. There are 
      several alternatives but XNA is currently the only managed interface to 
      all of the features of the graphics hardware that will be maintained by 
      Microsoft from now on.</P>
      <P>In the process of developing this program, several unusual aspects of 
      the F# language have been covered. Most notably the creation of native 
      .NET events in order to satisfy existing interfaces that require them.</P>
      <P>Future F#.NET Journal articles will revisit XNA, particularly in the 
      context of games programming.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
