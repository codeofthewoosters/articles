      <H1>Working with Regular Expressions</H1>
      <P>Regular expressions are a domain-specific language for pattern matching 
      over sequences of characters. This functionality provides a concise and 
      efficient way to dissect strings and, consequently, is used in many forms 
      of string processing including the definition of lexers. This article 
      describes how .NET's support for regular expressions can be used to 
      manpulate strings easily and efficiently from the F# programming 
      language.</P>
      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P>The .NET framework provides an excellent high-performance regular 
      expression library that is easy to use from F#. The library generates 
      interpreted code by default but can also be used to generate 
      high-performance optimized native code for the best possible speed when 
      the same regular expression will be used many times either on many strings 
      or on very large strings.</P>
      <P>We begin by opening this namespace:</P>
<PRE>&gt; open System.Text.RegularExpressions;;</PRE>
      <H3>Creating a regular expression</H3>
      <P>The name "regular expression" is often abbreviated to regexp or regex. 
      The .NET framework uses the class              <CODE>Regex</CODE> to 
      represent regular expressions. For example, the following regular 
      expression matches the four character sequence              <I>this</I> 
      verbatim:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let re = Regex "test";;
val re : Regex</PRE>
      <H3>Searching for a match</H3>
      <P>A given string may be matched against the regular expression            
        <CODE>re</CODE>           </P>
<PRE>&gt; re.IsMatch "This is a testament to their work";;
val it : bool = true
&gt; re.IsMatch "Tested my patience";;
val it : bool = false</PRE>
      <P>Note that the second string does not match even though it contains the 
      word "Tested" because the case of the first letter is different from that 
      required by the regular expression, which is case sensitive by 
default.</P>
      <H3>Regex options</H3>
      <P>Regular expressions may have some options such as case insensitivity 
      defined when they are created by passing an additional              
      <CODE>RegexOptions</CODE> to the              <CODE>Regex</CODE> 
      constructor:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; Regex("test", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase).IsMatch "Tested my patience";;
val it : bool = true</PRE>
      <P>The following options may be used:</P>

      <P></P>
      <P>Note that case insensitivity can also be specified for part of a 
      regular expression by preceding it with              <CODE>(?i)</CODE> as 
      follows:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; Regex("(?i)test").IsMatch "Tested my patience";;
val it : bool = true</PRE>
      <H3>Matching characters</H3>
      <P>Case insensitivity is useful but the ability to arbitrarily specify 
      which characters you wish to match is more powerful. To do this, we begin 
      to build our string patterns using the domain specific language of regular 
      expressions.</P>
      <P>The dot symbol              <CODE>.</CODE> in a regular expression 
      matches any character except newline:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let re = Regex ".";;
val re : Regex
&gt; re.Replace("Gary Foolow was\nin the foo", "X");;
val it : string = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXX"</PRE>
      <P>Currying can be used to factor out the commonality between the string 
      replacements we keep making:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let replace re (sub: string) input =
    (Regex re).Replace(input, sub);;
val replace : string -&gt; string -&gt; string -&gt; string</PRE>
      <P>Note that a type annotation on the              <CODE>sub</CODE> 
      parameter to the              <CODE>replace</CODE> function is required 
      because the              <CODE>Replace</CODE> member of the              
      <CODE>Regex</CODE> class is overloaded.           </P>
      <P>We can now partially apply our new              <CODE>replace</CODE> 
      function to a regular expression and substitution and then, for example, 
      map the resulting closure over a sequence of strings to perform 
      replacements on all of them. However, this implementation of the           
         <CODE>replace</CODE> function will construct many identical objects of 
      the              <CODE>Regex</CODE> class. Hoisting the construction 
      allows us to write the              <CODE>replace</CODE> function much 
      more efficiently when its partial application is repeatedly applied:       
          </P>
<PRE>&gt; let replace re =
    let re = Regex re
    fun (sub: string) input -&gt;
      re.Replace(input, sub);;
val replace : string -&gt; (string -&gt; string -&gt; string)</PRE>
      <P>Note that the type attributed to this function is slightly different, 
      using superfluous parentheses to highlight the fact that intermediate 
      computation requires the generation of a closure (required to capture the  
                  <I>free variable</I>             <CODE>re</CODE> from its 
      environment).           </P>
      <P>The implementation of regular expressions in the .NET framework 
      provides many different shortcuts for common sets of characters. The 
      documentation contains a full list and we shall only mention one other:    
                <CODE>\s</CODE> is used to match any whitespace character:       
          </P>
<PRE>&gt; replace "\s" "#" "One two\tthree\nfour";;
val it : string = "One#two#three#four"</PRE>
      <P>Note that this handles tabs and newlines as whitespace.</P>
      <P>The construct              <CODE>[...]</CODE> matches any of a set of 
      characters. In particular, ranges of characters may be specified by the 
      form              <CODE>[a-z]</CODE> . For example, individual digits may 
      be matched as follows:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; replace "[0-9]" "X" "1 + 2 * 3 = 7";;
val it : string = "X + X * X = X"</PRE>
      <P>Note that this is slightly different to              <CODE>fslex</CODE>
       , where the regular expression used to match a digit is written in the 
      form              <CODE>['0'-'9']</CODE> .           </P>
      <P>Similarly, the construct              <CODE>[^...]</CODE> matches any 
      character not in the given set. For example, replacing the non-digit 
      non-whitespace characters instead:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; replace "[^0-9\\s]" "X" "1 + 2 * 3 = 7";;
val it : string = "1 X 2 X 3 X 7"</PRE>
      <P>The symbol              <CODE>^</CODE> matches the beginning of the 
      input and the symbol              <CODE>$</CODE> matches the end of the 
      input:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; replace "^" "X" "A\nquick\ntest";;
val it : string = "XA\nquick\ntest"
&gt; replace "$" "X" "A\nquick\ntest";;
val it : string = "A\nquick\ntestX"</PRE>
      <P>The infix operator              <CODE>|</CODE> matches either of the 
      regular expressions that it lies between. For example, the following 
      regular expression matches the digits 1, 2 and 7 (but not 3):           
      </P>
<PRE>&gt; replace "1|2|7" "X" "1 + 2 * 3 = 7";;
val it : string = "X + X * 3 = X"</PRE>
      <P>Finally, the special characters              <CODE>. $ ^ { [ ( | ) * + 
      ? \</CODE> are matched by escaping them with a preceding              
      <CODE>\</CODE> . For example, the following regular expression matches the 
                   <CODE>+</CODE> and              <CODE>*</CODE> characters:    
             </P>
<PRE>&gt; replace "\\+|\\*" "X" "1 + 2 * 3 = 7";;
val it : string = "1 X 2 X 3 = 7"</PRE>
      <P>Note that the              <CODE>\</CODE> character in the string 
      literal in the F# code must be escaped itself using another              
      <CODE>\</CODE> character. So the string              <CODE>\+|\*</CODE> is 
      being written as the string literal              <CODE>"\\+|\\*"</CODE> .  
               </P>
      <H3>Matching sequences</H3>
      <P>The atomic regular expressions described in the previous section may be 
      generalized to sequences using the postfix              <CODE>*</CODE> and 
                   <CODE>+</CODE> operators where the former matches zero or 
      more repeats and the latter matches one or more repeats. This concept 
      should be familiar from our previous more general but much less efficient 
      formulation in terms of parser combinators.           </P>
      <P>For example, the following extends our previous matching of single 
      digits with a regular expression that matches integers (sequences of one 
      or more digits):</P>
<PRE>&gt; replace "[0-9]+" "X" "12 + 23 * 34 = 794";;
val it : string = "X + X * X = X"</PRE>
      <P>Note how the entire integers were replaced by a single              
      <CODE>'X'</CODE> .           </P>
      <P>As we saw with lexers, this allows us to match some simple tokens such 
      as an identifier that consists of a letter followed by a sequence of zero 
      or more alphanumeric characters:</P>
<PRE>&gt; replace "[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*" "&lt;ident&gt;"
    "let rec f1 = function 0 -&gt; 1 | n -&gt; n * f1(n - 1)";;
val it : string
= "&lt;ident&gt; &lt;ident&gt; &lt;ident&gt; = &lt;ident&gt; 0 -&gt; 1 | &lt;ident&gt; -&gt; &lt;ident&gt; * &lt;ident&gt;(&lt;ident&gt; - 1)"</PRE>
      <P>Note that the identifier              <CODE>f1</CODE> is matched.       
          </P>
      <H3>Groups</H3>
      <P>Finding matches and replacing them is one application of regular 
      expressions but it is often desirable to extract parts of the matched 
      string according to the regular expression that was used. This is achieved 
      using a concept known as              <I>groups</I> .           </P>
      <P>A group is defined using the syntax              <CODE>(...)</CODE> in 
      the regular expression. The              <CODE>Groups</CODE> property of a 
      resulting              <CODE>Match</CODE> can then be used to extract the 
      string that was found to match a given group.           </P>
      <P>For example, the following matches the first identifier              
      <CODE>a1</CODE> and its groups match the              <CODE>a</CODE> and 
      the              <CODE>1</CODE> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let m = (Regex "([A-Za-z]+)([0-9]+)").Match "a1 + b2 = c3";;
val m : Match
&gt; m.Groups;;
val it : GroupCollection
= seq [a1 {Captures = seq [...];
           Groups = ...;
           Index = 0;
           Length = 2;
           Success = true;
           Value = "a1";}; a {Captures = seq [...];
                              Index = 0;
                              Length = 1;
                              Success = true;
                              Value = "a";}; 1 {Captures = seq [...];
                                                Index = 1;
                                                Length = 1;
                                                Success = true;
                                                Value = "1";}]</PRE>
      <H3>MatchEvaluator</H3>
      <P>The following defines a              <CODE>subst</CODE> function that 
      returns the first two groups separated by an underscore:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let subst (m: Match) =
    sprintf "%s_%s" m.Groups.[1].Value m.Groups.[2].Value;;
val subst : Match -&gt; string</PRE>
      <P>This may be used to construct a              
      <CODE>MatchEvaluator</CODE> that can be used to perform more intelligent 
      replacements, in this case replacing letters followed by digits with 
      letters followed by an underscore and then the digits:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; (Regex "([A-Za-z]+)([0-9]+)").Replace("a1 + b2 = c3", MatchEvaluator subst);;
val it : string = "a_1 + b_2 = c_3"</PRE>
      <P>Groups may also be referred to by number within the regular expression 
      itself as              <CODE>\1</CODE> and so forth. This allows us to 
      represent the same sequence of characters matching in more than one place. 
      For example, this replaces              <CODE>x*x</CODE> with              
      <CODE>x^2</CODE> for any              <CODE>x</CODE> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let subst (m: Match) =
    sprintf "%s^2" m.Groups.[1].Value;;
&gt; (Regex "(.+)\\*\\1").Replace("a*x*x+b*x+c", MatchEvaluator subst);;
val it : string = "a*x^2+b*x+c"</PRE>
      <P>Note that              <CODE>*</CODE> is a special character in a 
      regular expression and must be escaped using a preceding              
      <CODE>\</CODE> that is itself escaped in the string literal.           
</P>
      <H3>Searching</H3>
      <P>The              <CODE>Matches</CODE> member of the              
      <CODE>Regex</CODE> class can be used to find all substrings in the input 
      matching a regular expression:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let ms = (Regex "([A-Za-z]+)([0-9]+)").Matches "a1 + b2 = c3";;
val ms : MatchCollection</PRE>
      <P>The resulting              <CODE>MatchCollection</CODE> does not 
      implement the              <CODE>IEnumerable</CODE> interface so we cannot 
      use F#'s              <CODE>Seq</CODE> module on it directly. However, we 
      can use a sequence expression to create an ordinary sequence from a        
            <CODE>MatchCollection</CODE> as follows:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; seq { for i in 0 .. ms.Count-1 do
          yield ms.[i] }
  |&gt; Seq.map (fun m -&gt; m.Value);;
val it : seq&lt;string&gt; = seq ["a1"; "b2"; "c3"]</PRE>
      <P>The result shows that the regular expression found the three 
      identifiers in the equation.</P>
      <H3>Splitting</H3>
      <P>One of the main applications of regular expressions in F# programs is 
      splitting strings into substrings according to simple regular 
      expressions.</P>
      <P>The              <CODE>Split</CODE> member function of the              
      <CODE>Regex</CODE> class returns an array containing all of the substrings 
      that were separated by matches of the regular expression. For example, the 
      following divides sentences into words by splitting at whitespace and 
      punctuation:           </P>

      <H2>Summary</H2>
      <P>This article has described how the .NET regular expression 
      implementation can be used from F# programs. This library is simple and 
      sufficiently efficient for most purposes, providing string search, split 
      and replace functionality.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
