      <H1>2D Scalable Vector Graphics with XNA: part 1</H1>
      <P>Vector graphics represent images in terms of lines and curves on a 
      fictional canvas. This resolution-independent representation is ideal for 
      high resolution output devices such as printers but the inevitable march 
      of technology has ossified vector graphics on the desktop as a fundamental 
      component of both Apple's and Microsoft's latest graphical user 
      interfaces. Vector graphics are best represented as trees and manipulated 
      using recursion. Consequently, F# is an extremely powerful tool for 
      writing programs that manipulate vector graphics. This article describes 
      the design and implementation of a simple library for 2D vector graphics 
      written in F# and using XNA for visualization. This would be ideal for 
      games that include 2D graphics with lots of zooming.</P>
      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P>The PostScript and PDF file formats are perhaps the best-known forms of 
      vector graphics. The single most important benefit of vector graphics is 
      the ability to zoom into images without incurring the blockiness inherent 
      in pixmap formats such as JPEG, PNG and GIF.</P>
      <P>Unusually, the PostScript format is actually a complete programming 
      language capable of arbitrary computation. Years ago, many PostScript 
      users wrote in this language by hand in order to generate diagrams and 
      images for their documents.</P>
      <P>The following excerpt from a PostScript vector graphic illustrates the 
      core features of this format:</P>
<PRE>newpath
100 200 moveto
200 250 lineto
100 300 lineto
closepath
gsave
0.5 setgray
fill
grestore
4 setlinewidth
0.75 setgray
stroke</PRE>
      <P>This is quite a readable format. The              <CODE>newpath</CODE> 
      command denotes the start of a new path. A path is composed of line and 
      curve segments. The              <CODE>moveto</CODE> instruction moves a 
      fictional pen to the given location on a 2D plane and the subsequent       
             <CODE>lineto</CODE> commands describe the outline of a shape. The 
      path is closed, saved and filled before being restored and then stroked 
      with a pen of the specified width.           </P>
      <P>In this article, we shall develop a simple vector graphics renderer 
      that provides the core functionality required to draw such vector 
      graphics. In particular, we shall implement only the filling of (possibly 
      non-concave) vector shapes.</P>
      <P>Our program is composed of the following modules:</P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Segment module for straight line and cubic Bezier path 
segments.</LI>
        <LI>Contour module for open and closed paths of segments.</LI>
        <LI>Tux module containing an example vector graphic of Linux logo.</LI>
        <LI>Main program responsible for interoperating with XNA including 
        vertex and pixel shaders and user interaction.</LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>Let's examine each of these modules in turn.</P>
      <H2>Path segments</H2>
      <P>We begin with a              <CODE>Segment</CODE> module that we shall 
      put in a separate Segment.fs file in order to structure the whole F# 
      project nicely. The source code for this module is as follows:           
      </P>
<PRE>open Microsoft.Xna.Framework
open Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics</PRE>
<PRE>type t =
  | Line of Vector2
  | Bezier of Vector2 * Vector2 * Vector2</PRE>
<PRE>let point_to_line (a: Vector2) b c =
  let ab = b - a
  let lambda = Vector2.Dot(c - a, ab)
  let lambda = max 0.f (min 1.f lambda)
  let d = a + lambda * ab
  (c - d).Length()</PRE>
<PRE>let deviation s c1 c2 e =
  max (point_to_line s e c1) (point_to_line s e c2)</PRE>
<PRE>let private combine t (r1: Vector2) (r2: Vector2) =
  t * r1 + (1.f - t) * r2</PRE>
<PRE>let rec flatten_bezier delta f s1 c1 c2 e =
  if deviation s1 c1 c2 e &lt; delta then f e else
    let t = 0.5f
    let b0, b1, b2 = combine t s1 c1, combine t c1 c2, combine t c2 e
    let bb0, bb1 = combine t b0 b1, combine t b1 b2
    let bbb = combine t bb0 bb1
    flatten_bezier delta f s1 b0 bb0 bbb
    flatten_bezier delta f bbb bb1 b2 e</PRE>
<PRE>let flatten delta f s seg =

  | Line e -&gt; f e
  | Bezier(c1, c2, e) -&gt; flatten_bezier delta f s c1 c2 e</PRE>
<PRE>let get_end (Line e | Bezier(_, _, e)) = e</PRE>
      <P>This is written in a classic OCaml style using a type called            
        <CODE>Segment.t</CODE> to represent segments. This variant type contains 
      lines and Bezier curves. Bezier curves are parametric in both              
      <I>x</I> and              <I>y</I> and, in this case, we have decided to 
      allow two control points so the curves are cubics. Note that the start 
      point of a segment is implicit because it will be the end point of the 
      previous segment in the path.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>point_to_line</CODE> function computes the 
      distance from the point              <CODE>c</CODE> to a finite line from  
                  <CODE>a</CODE> to              <CODE>b</CODE> . Note that we 
      are using the              <CODE>Vector2</CODE> type from XNA to represent 
      coordinates.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>deviation</CODE> function computes the maximum 
      deviation of a Bezier curve              <CODE>(s, c1, c2, e)</CODE> from 
      its straight-line approximant              <CODE>(s, e)</CODE> . Bezier 
      curves are bounded by the convex hull of their start, end and control 
      points so the maximum deviation cannot be greater than the distance from 
      the line to either control point. We use this to calculate an upper bound 
      on the deviation.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>combine</CODE> function linearly interpolates 
      from              <CODE>r2</CODE> to              <CODE>r1</CODE> using 
      the parameter              <CODE>t</CODE> which is in the range 0..1.      
           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>flatten_bezier</CODE> function recursively 
      subdivides a Bezier curve, splitting it at its parametric coordinate t=0.5 
      to create two Bezier curves that are subdivided until the deviation of the 
      curve from its straight-line approximate is sufficiently small (subpixel) 
      that the curve can be approximated to sufficient accuracy. This is a 
      higher-order function similar to              <CODE>iter</CODE> that 
      applies its function argument              <CODE>f</CODE> to point along 
      the flattened approximant in turn.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>flatten</CODE> function handles segments, 
      returning lines immediately and using the              
      <CODE>flatten_bezier</CODE> function to flatten curves.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>get_end</CODE> function returns the end point of 
      either kind of segment. Note that this is accomplished entirely using the 
      pattern match in the argument of the function.           </P>
      <H2>Paths</H2>
      <P>Paths are sequences of segments. In the interests of generality, our 
      representation of paths will handle both open and closed paths, although 
      the renderer will only render the interiors of paths and, therefore, 
      handles only closed paths:</P>
<PRE>open Microsoft.Xna.Framework
open Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics</PRE>
<PRE>type t =
  | Open of Vector2 * Segment.t list
  | Closed of Segment.t list</PRE>
<PRE>let flatten_aux delta f s seg =
  Segment.flatten delta f s seg
  Segment.get_end seg</PRE>
<PRE>let flatten delta f = function
  | Open(s, segs) -&gt;
      f s
      List.fold (flatten_aux delta f) s segs
      |&gt; ignore
  | Closed [] -&gt; ()
  | Closed(seg::segs) -&gt;
      let s = Segment.get_end seg
      let s = List.fold (flatten_aux delta f) s segs
      Segment.flatten delta f s seg</PRE>
      <P>Again, we use a type              <CODE>t</CODE> to represent the core 
      data structure.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>flatten_aux</CODE> function is an auxiliary 
      function designed to be folded over a sequence of segments, flattening 
      each in turn and accumulating the start point of the next segment as the 
      end point of the previous segment.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>flatten</CODE> function flattens an entire path 
      by flattening each segment in turn. Open paths have an explicit start 
      point. Closed paths start from the second segment, with the fold returning 
      the end point of the last segment that is then used to flatten the first 
      segment. Note how pattern matching is used to handle the both an empty 
      closed path in one match case and to destructure the path, extracting the 
      first segment, in the general case for a closed path.           </P>
      <H2>Vertex and Pixel shader</H2>
      <P>We define an XNA effect called              <CODE>Flat</CODE> that 
      implements simple vertex and pixel shaders that simply transform the 2D 
      position and copy the color information:           </P>
<PRE>let hlsl =
  "
float4x4 view;

<PRE>struct Vertex
{
    float4 Position : POSITION;
    float4 Color    : COLOR0;
};</PRE>
<PRE>Vertex VertexShader(float2 position : POSITION,
                    float4 color : COLOR)

     float4x4 wvp = mul(view, projection);
     
     output.Position = mul(float4(position, 0.0, 1.0), wvp);

		PixelShader  = compile ps_2_0 PixelShader();
	}
}"</PRE>
      <H2>Main program</H2>
      <P>We begin by defining a              <CODE>Vertex</CODE> struct type 
      with a              <CODE>VertexElements</CODE> static member that XNA 
      requires to handle custom vertex arrays:           </P>
<PRE>open Microsoft.Xna.Framework
open Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input
open Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics</PRE>
<PRE>type Vertex = struct
  val Position : Vector2
  val Color : Color
  new(p, n, c) = { Position = p; Color = c }
  
  static member VertexElements =
    let vec2 = VertexElementFormat.Vector2
    let vec = VertexElementFormat.Color
    let m = VertexElementMethod.Default
    let o n = sizeof&lt;float32&gt; * n |&gt; int16
    [|
      VertexElement(0s, o 0, vec2, m, VertexElementUsage.Position, 0uy);
      VertexElement(0s, o 2, vec, m, VertexElementUsage.Color, 0uy);
    |]
end</PRE>
      <P>In this case, a vertex is simply a 2D position and a color.</P>
      <P>The non-trivial aspect of rendering 2D vector graphics is handling 
      non-concave polygons. There are two main solutions to this problem:</P>
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI>Tesselate the flattened path into a set of non-overlapping triangles 
        in software and render them in hardware.</LI>
        <LI>Use the hardware stencil buffer to determine coverage on a per-pixel 
        basis.</LI></OL>
      <P></P>
      <P>The rule of thumb is that off-loading as much computation as possible 
      onto the dedicated hardware of the graphics subsystem generally improves 
      performance. However, that is not necessarily the case here. Firstly, the 
      hardware stencil buffer solution is performing simple computations in 
      parallel per pixel whereas the software tesselation solution is performing 
      more complicated computations but only per triangle. Secondly, when 
      animating 2D vector graphics there is high probability that a 
      software-generated tesselation that was accurate enough from one frame of 
      animation will still be accurate enough in the next. Consequently, a 
      production-quality vector graphics implementation is likely to consider 
      both solutions. However, we shall only implement the hardware-based 
      solution here in the interests of simplicity because software tesselation 
      is an extremely complicated subject.</P>
      <P>Rendering vector graphics using the stencil buffer requires us to be 
      able to render into the stencil buffer and not the color buffer. Thus, we 
      use the two following functions to disable and enable rendering to the 
      color buffer:</P>
<PRE>let draw_disable (s: RenderState) =
  s.AlphaBlendEnable &lt;- true
  s.SourceBlend &lt;- Blend.Zero
  s.DestinationBlend &lt;- Blend.One</PRE>
<PRE>let draw_enable (s: RenderState) =
  s.AlphaBlendEnable &lt;- false
  s.SourceBlend &lt;- Blend.One
  s.DestinationBlend &lt;- Blend.Zero</PRE>
      <P>The following function renders a user vertex array as a triangle 
      fan:</P>
<PRE>let draw_trianglefan (gd: GraphicsDevice) (vertex: Vertex array) =
  gd.DrawUserPrimitives(PrimitiveType.TriangleFan, vertex, 0, vertex.Length - 2)</PRE>

<PRE>      for vertex in vertex do</PRE>
      <P>We clear the stencil buffer:</P>
<PRE>        gd.Clear(ClearOptions.Stencil, Color.Black, 0.f, 0)</PRE>
      <P>We disable drawing to the color buffer and render the path as a 
      triangle fan into the stencil buffer, inverting the state of the stencil 
      buffer every time a pixel is rendered:</P>
<PRE>        draw_disable s
        s.StencilFunction &lt;- CompareFunction.Always
        s.StencilFail &lt;- StencilOperation.Keep
        s.StencilDepthBufferFail &lt;- StencilOperation.Keep
        s.StencilPass &lt;- StencilOperation.Invert
        s.StencilMask &lt;- -1
        draw_trianglefan gd vertex</PRE>
      <P>This has left non-zeros in the stencil buffer for any pixels that are 
      "inside" our path. Finally, we render the pixels inside our path by 
      enabling the color buffer but setting the stencil mode such that only 
      pixels with non-zero values are filled:</P>
<PRE>        draw_enable s
        s.StencilFunction &lt;- CompareFunction.NotEqual
        s.StencilFail &lt;- StencilOperation.Keep
        s.StencilDepthBufferFail &lt;- StencilOperation.Keep
        s.StencilPass &lt;- StencilOperation.Keep
        s.StencilMask &lt;- -1
        draw_trianglefan gd vertex</PRE>
<PRE>      pass.End()
    effect.End()</PRE>
      <P>Finally, we write the main program that constructs our class and called 
      its              <CODE>Run</CODE> member to run the XNA program:           
      </P>
<PRE>do
  use game = new Tux()
  game.Window.AllowUserResizing &lt;- true
  game.Run()</PRE>
      <H2>Results</H2>
      <P>When run, this program renders the following image and allows the user 
      to drag the image around:</P>

      <H2>Summary</H2>
      <P>This article has described a remarkably simple program that uses XNA 
      and the hardware stencil buffer to render 2D vector graphics easily and 
      efficiently.</P>
      <P>Computer graphics provides a wealth of fascinating algorithms and data 
      structures that are very rewarding and enlightening to implement. Thus, we 
      shall revisit this subject in future F#.NET Journal articles as we evolve 
      a much more powerful rendering engine.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
