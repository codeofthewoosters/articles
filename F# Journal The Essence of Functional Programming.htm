      <H1>The Essence of Functional Programming</H1>
      <P>Most programmers learning F# will be coming from a background of 
      object-oriented programming languages like C++, Java and C#. For those 
      readers, it is vitally important to forget about object-oriented 
      programming when learning the F# programming language, even though it 
      exposes the OO features of the .NET platform.</P>
      <P>F# is fundamentally a functional programming language and the use of 
      functions instead of objects often leads to shorter and clearer code. 
      Indeed, many of the benefits of functional programming are already known 
      to OO programmers in the form of "design patterns".</P>
      <P>This article will elucidate the essential properties of functional 
      programming, covering three main topics:</P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Immutability</LI>
        <LI>Recursion</LI>
        <LI>Functions as values</LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>We shall now explain each of these concepts in detail before providing 
      several examples that demonstrate the clarity and power of functional 
      programming.</P>
      <H2>Immutability</H2>
      <P>The benefits of C's              <CODE>const</CODE> are widely 
      documented. This keyword allows a variable to be marked as a constant, 
      declaring it to be immutable. The value of the variable cannot then be 
      changed and any attempt to do so is picked up as an error by the compiler. 
      Whenever a variable is known to be constant, marking its declaration with  
                  <CODE>const</CODE> helps to catch errors.           </P>
      <P>The F# language takes              <CODE>const</CODE> a step further. 
      In F#, all atomic values are immutable by default. The affect on atomic 
      values is quite innocuous but the extensive use of immutability and, in 
      particular, the development of wholly immutable data structures is a very 
      interesting and powerful concept. Let us look at the small-scale effects 
      of immutability before addressing the design of immutable data structures. 
                </P>
      <H3>Immutable variables</H3>
      <P>Consider the following declaration of              <CODE>x</CODE> :     
            </P>
<PRE>&gt; let x = 3;;
val x : int</PRE>
      <P>This is actually equivalent to the C++:</P>
<PRE>const int x = 3;</PRE>
      <P>Note that              <CODE>x</CODE> is still referred to as a 
      "variable" in F#, even though its value cannot be varied. The term 
      "variable" simply means a              <I>named value</I> in F#.           
      </P>
      <P>Learning how to evolve a value in the presence of immutability is easy. 
      A sequence of mutating assignments in C:</P>
<PRE>int x=2;
x = 3*x;
x = x+1;</PRE>
      <P>can be translated into a sequence of redeclarations in F#:</P>
<PRE>let x = 2
let x = 3*x
let x = x+1</PRE>
      <P>Each redeclaration of              <CODE>x</CODE> supercedes the 
      previous declaration and any use of              <CODE>x</CODE> in the 
      body of a              <CODE>let x =</CODE> definition refers to the 
      previous definition of              <CODE>x</CODE> .           </P>
      <P>Note that redeclarations are not allowed in the top-level of compiled 
      code in F#. In such cases, different variable names must be used rather 
      than superceding the same name.</P>
      <H3>Immutable data structures</H3>
      <P>Two core concepts underpin the design and use of immutable data 
      structures:</P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Referential transparency</LI>
        <LI>Recursive data structures</LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>Referential transparency refers to the fact that immutable data 
      structures never need to be copied. Consequently, functional programming 
      languages like F# always confer data structures by reference. Composing a 
      new data structure from parts of an old data structure simply refers to 
      the existing data rather than copying it.</P>
      <P>Lists are immutable in F# and the following function accepts an element 
                   <CODE>h</CODE> and a list              <CODE>t</CODE> and 
      returns the list that results from prepending              <CODE>h</CODE> 
      onto              <CODE>t</CODE> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let prepend h t = h::t;;
val prepend : 'a -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'a list</PRE>
      <P>The follow example demonstrates that the              
      <CODE>prepend</CODE> function leaves the original list unaltered, whilst 
      the returned list refers to the original:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let list = [1; 2; 3];;
val list : int list
&gt; prepend 0 list;;
val it : int list = [0; 1; 2; 3]
&gt; list;;
val it : int list = [1; 2; 3]</PRE>
      <P>A recursive data structure is any data structure with a definition that 
      refers to itself. In the case of a tree, child nodes are also trees so a 
      tree is an example of a recursive data structure. In addition to allowing 
      simple declarations of many important data structures, functions that act 
      upon such data structures can be written simply using recursion.</P>
      <P>The following data type defines a simple binary tree with values at the 
      nodes and empty leaves:</P>
<PRE>&gt; type 'a tree =
    | Node of 'a tree * 'a * 'a tree
    | Empty;;</PRE>
      <P>Note that this type definition is recursive because the arguments of 
      the              <CODE>Node</CODE> constructor are trees.           </P>
      <P>Binary trees like the              <CODE>tree</CODE> type are very 
      common in functional programming and similar types underpin the built-in   
                 <CODE>Set</CODE> and              <CODE>Map</CODE> 
      implementations.           </P>
      <P>As a consequence of referential transparency and the use of recursive 
      data structures, actions that develop immutable data structures (such as 
      adding elements to a set) typically result in a new data structure that 
      contains references back to the internals of the original data 
      structure.</P>
      <P>The primary benefit of immutability is simplicity. In practice, the 
      simplicity of immutable data structures often results in performance 
      improvements. For example, when computing the union of two sets, the use 
      of mutable data structures typically results in excessive copying (see the 
                   <CODE>set_union</CODE> implementation in the C++ standard 
      library, for example) whereas immutable data structures allow the input 
      sets to be referred to by the output set.           </P>
      <H2>Recursion</H2>
      <P>A recursive function is a function that calls itself. This approach is 
      often used for divide-and-conquer algorithms, where a problem is split 
      into smaller parts and the function invokes itself recursively to solve 
      the smaller parts.</P>
      <P>As we have seen, the default behaviour of a              
      <CODE>let</CODE> definition is to assume that all variables have already 
      been defined, allowing variable definitions to be superceded. In order to 
      define a recursive function, it is necessary to use the variable being 
      defined in the body of its definition. This is achieved by supplementing 
      the definition with the              <CODE>rec</CODE> keyword.           
      </P>
      <H3>Example: Raise to positive integer power</H3>
      <P>A function that raises a floating point number              
      <CODE>x</CODE> to a positive integer power              <CODE>n</CODE> may 
      be written:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec ipow x = function
    | 0 -&gt; 1.
    | n -&gt; x * ipow x (n-1);;
val ipow : float -&gt; int -&gt; float</PRE>
      <P>This function reduces the problem of an arbitrary exponent              
      <CODE>n</CODE> into a problem involving              <CODE>n-1</CODE> 
      using the recurrence relation              <I>x               <SUP>n</SUP> 
      = x x               <SUP>n-1</SUP>             </I> .           </P>
      <P>The performance of this algorithm can be improved by trying to bisect 
      the exponent each iteration rather than decrementing it:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let sqr (x : float) = x * x;;
val sqr : float -&gt; float
&gt; let rec ipow x = function
    | 0 -&gt; 1.
    | 1 -&gt; x
    | n when n%2 = 0 -&gt; sqr(ipow x (n/2))
    | n -&gt; x * sqr(ipow x (n/2));;
val ipow : float -&gt; int -&gt; float</PRE>
      <P>The time taken to execute this function now scales as O(log n) rather 
      than O(n).</P>
      <H3>Example: Binary tree</H3>
      <P>Functions that handle recursive data structures are most naturally 
      recursive themselves.</P>
      <P>The data type representing a binary tree is most easily manipulated 
      using recursive functions. A function to insert a new element into an 
      ordered tree may be written:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec add x = function
    | Empty -&gt; Node(Empty, x, Empty)
    | Node(l, v, r) when x&lt;v -&gt; Node(add x l, v, r)
    | Node(l, v, r) when x&gt;v -&gt; Node(l, v, add x r)
    | Node(l, v, r) -&gt; Node(l, x, r);;
val add : 'a -&gt; 'a tree -&gt; 'a tree</PRE>
      <P>Note that this function is recursive: it calls itself to insert the 
      given element into the left or right child tree when necessary.</P>
      <P>When this function composes a result using an expression like           
         <CODE>Node(add x l, v, r)</CODE> , the values of              
      <CODE>v</CODE> and              <CODE>r</CODE> refer back to parts of the 
      input data structure. Consequently, this function only generates new tree 
      nodes on the path from the root to the node containing the inserted value 
      and does not copy the entire tree. Parts of tree that can no longer be 
      referenced are deallocated by the garbage collector.           </P>
      <H2>Functions as values</H2>
      <P>Perhaps the most important functionality provided by functional 
      programming languages is the ability to handle functions like any other 
      value. In a functional language, functions may be passed as arguments to 
      other functions, returned by functions and stored in data structures. This 
      style of programming leads to several design patterns that are prominent 
      in functional programming languages and provide unrivalled elegance when 
      solving many problems.</P>
      <P>We shall now examine each of these patterns in detail.</P>
      <H3>Higher-order functions</H3>
      <P>A function that accepts another function as an argument is known as a   
                 <I>higher-order function</I> .           </P>
      <P>Higher-order functions are very common in functional programming. In 
      particular, higher-order functions are often provided with data structures 
      to apply a given function to the elements of a container. This replaces a 
      common use of              <CODE>for</CODE> loops in conventional 
      programming languages.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>List</CODE> module provides a              
      <CODE>map</CODE> function that creates a new list with each element given 
      by the result of applying a given function to the corresponding element in 
      the input list:           </P>
<PRE>val map : ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'b list</PRE>
      <P>For example, the square of each element in a list is given by:</P>
<PRE>&gt; List.map (fun n -&gt; n*n) [1 .. 5];;
val it : int list = [1; 4; 9; 16; 25]</PRE>
      <P>This use of higher-order functions is very common and most of the data 
      structures in the F# standard library provide              
      <CODE>map</CODE> functions.           </P>
      <H3>Curried functions</H3>
      <P>A function that returns another function as its return value is known 
      as a              <I>curried function</I> .           </P>
      <P>Curried functions are also a common idiom in functional programming, so 
      much so that the F# language provides concise syntax for defining curried 
      functions.</P>
      <P>The syntax              <CODE>let f x y = ...</CODE> defines a curried 
      function              <CODE>f</CODE> that accepts an argument              
      <CODE>x</CODE> and returns a function that accepts an argument             
       <CODE>y</CODE> .           </P>
      <P>Perhaps the simplest example of a curried function is the built-in add 
      function, denoted              <CODE>( + )</CODE> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; ( + );;
val it : int -&gt; int -&gt; int</PRE>
      <P>As this function is curried, the first argument can be applied to 
      obtain a new function:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let inc = ( + ) 1;;
val inc : int -&gt; int</PRE>
      <P>In this case, partially applying              <CODE>1</CODE> as the 
      first argument has resulted in a function that adds one to the given 
      integer.           </P>
      <P>For example, the increment of 3 is 4:</P>
<PRE>&gt; inc 3;;
val it : int = 4</PRE>
      <P>The definition of this              <CODE>inc</CODE> function may be 
      supplied to the              <CODE>List.map</CODE> function:           
</P>
<PRE>&gt; List.map (( + ) 1) [1; 2; 3];;
val it : int list = [2; 3; 4]</PRE>
      <P>The ability to partially apply the arguments of a function to obtain a 
      more specialized function is the primary benefit of currying.</P>
      <H3>Combinators</H3>
      <P>A combinator is a curried higher-order function that is used to combine 
      other functions.</P>
      <P>Combinators are useful because they allow functions to be composed in 
      non-trivial ways to get a task done.</P>
      <P>As the              <CODE>List.map</CODE> function is both higher-order 
      and curried, it can be composed. For example, a map function for a nested 
      list of lists may be written in terms of the              
      <CODE>List.map</CODE> function as:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let map_2 f = List.map (List.map f);;
val map_2 : ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a list list -&gt; 'b list list</PRE>
      <P>This allows a function to be mapped over the elements inside a list of 
      lists:</P>
<PRE>&gt; map_2 (fun n -&gt; n*n) [[1; 2; 3]; [4; 5; 6]];;
- : int list list = [[1; 4; 9]; [16; 25; 36]]</PRE>
      <P>Note how succinctly the composition of functions allows new 
      functionality to be evolved.</P>
      <H3>Example: Timing combinator</H3>
      <P>The ability to time how long a function application takes can be very 
      useful. This can be implemented simply and efficiently as a 
combinator:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let time f x =
    let t = new System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch()
    t.Start()
    let f_x = f x
    printf "%fs\n" (Float.of_int64 t.ElapsedMilliseconds / 1e3)
    f_x;;
val time : ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b</PRE>
      <P>For example, the expression              <CODE>List.fold_left ( + ) 
      0</CODE> can be used to sum a list of integers and the application of this 
      function to a list may be timed using the              <CODE>time</CODE> 
      combinator:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; time (List.fold_left ( + ) 0I) [1I .. 1000000I];;
0.421s
val it : int = 500000500000</PRE>
      <P>Note the use of arbitrary-precision integers here, denoted by the 
      suffix              <CODE>I</CODE> . Also, the order of evaluation is 
      subtle but important. The list is built before the              
      <CODE>time</CODE> combinator is called. Only the application of the        
            <CODE>List.fold_left</CODE> function is timed.           </P>
      <P>The design of the              <CODE>time</CODE> function as a 
      combinator allows it to be used with minimal invasion, i.e. an existing 
      function application              <CODE>f x</CODE> can be timed by simply 
      altering the code to              <CODE>time f x</CODE> .           </P>
      <P>We shall use this              <CODE>time</CODE> combinator in future 
      examples.           </P>
      <H3>Example: Nesting combinator</H3>
      <P>The ability to repeatedly apply a function to a value is often useful, 
      e.g. to compute              <I>f(f(f(x)))</I> . This can be achieved 
      using a curried higher-order function              <CODE>nest</CODE> that 
      nests a function application a given number of times:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec nest n f x =
    match n with
    | 0 -&gt; x
    | n -&gt; nest (n-1) f (f x);;
val nest : int -&gt; ('a -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a</PRE>
      <P>The simple implementation of the              <CODE>ipow</CODE> 
      function may be written elegantly in terms of              
      <CODE>nest</CODE> and multiplication by              <CODE>x</CODE> :      
           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let ipow x n = nest n (( * ) x) 1.;;
val ipow : float -&gt; int -&gt; float = &lt;fun&gt;</PRE>
      <P>Note that the order of the arguments to the curried              
      <CODE>nest</CODE> function has been carefully chosen to allow the 
      parameter              <CODE>n</CODE> to be partially applied to get a 
      more specialized function that nests a certain number of times.           
      </P>
      <P>Combinators like the              <CODE>nest</CODE> function can often 
      be used as a means to factor out algorithms in a reusable way, resulting 
      in shorter and clearer programs.           </P>
      <H3>Example: Numerical derivative combinator</H3>
      <P>In mathematics, the derivative operator converts one function into 
      another and a numerical approximation may be written in F# as a 
      higher-order function:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let d f x =
    let dx = sqrt epsilon_float in
    (f(x + dx) - f(x - dx)) / (2. * dx);;
val d : (float -&gt; float) -&gt; float -&gt; float</PRE>
      <P>This function may be applied to a function              <CODE>f</CODE> 
      of the type              <CODE>float -&gt; float</CODE> to give a 
      numerical approximation to that function:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let f x = x ** 3. - x - 1.;;
val f : float -&gt; float</PRE>
      <P>For example, the numerical approximation of              <I>f(x) = x    
                 <SUP>3</SUP> - x - 1             </I> at              
      <I>x=2</I> is              <I>f'(2) = 11</I> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; d f 2.;;
val it : float = 11.</PRE>
      <P>Moreover, as the              <CODE>d</CODE> function is curried, it 
      can also be partially applied to give a derivative function:           
</P>
<PRE>&gt; let f' = d f;;
val f' : float -&gt; float</PRE>
      <P>The function              <CODE>f'</CODE> is a numerical approximation 
      to the derivative of              <CODE>f</CODE> .           </P>
<PRE>&gt; f' 2.;;
val it : float = 11.</PRE>
      <P>You can even combine the              <CODE>nest</CODE> combinator with 
      the              <CODE>d</CODE> combinator to obtain higher derivatives, 
      such as the third derivative of              <CODE>f</CODE> :           
      </P>
<PRE>&gt; let f''' = nest 3 d f;;
val f''' : float -&gt; float</PRE>
      <P>The use of combinators to implement mathematical operators in this way 
      clearly demonstrates the power of this approach in the context of 
      numerical computing.</P>
      <H2>Built-in functional operators</H2>
      <P>The F# language provides three built-in functional operators:           
         <CODE>|&gt;</CODE> ,              <CODE>&lt;&lt;</CODE> and             
       <CODE>&gt;&gt;</CODE> .           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>|&gt;</CODE> operator is function application in 
      reverse, i.e.              <CODE>x |&gt; f</CODE> is equivalent to         
           <CODE>f x</CODE> . This operator has two main uses. Primarily, this 
      operator allows a value to be "piped" through a series of functions. An 
      additional use is to present the argument to a function first so that the 
      compiler knows its type before the type of the function expression is 
      inferred.           </P>
      <P>For example, the following expression squares the elements of the input 
      list and then filters out elements below 10:</P>
<PRE>&gt; [1 .. 10] |&gt;
  List.map (fun n -&gt; n*n) |&gt;
  List.filter (fun n -&gt; n&lt;10);;
val it : int list = [1; 4; 9]</PRE>
      <P>The              <CODE>&lt;&lt;</CODE> operator provides function 
      composition, i.e.              <CODE>(f &lt;&lt; g) x</CODE> is equivalent 
      to              <CODE>f(g(x))</CODE> .           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>&gt;&gt;</CODE> operator provides reverse 
      function composition, i.e.              <CODE>(f &gt;&gt; g) x</CODE> is 
      equivalent to              <CODE>g(f(x))</CODE> .           </P>
      <H2>Case Study: Queens problem</H2>
      <P>A famous problem that serves as an excellent example of the use of 
      combinators in F# is the Queens Problem. The task is to find all 
      configurations of              <I>n</I> queens on an              
      <I>nï¿½n</I> chessboard such that no queen is attacking any other.         
        </P>
      <P>This program makes extensive use of lists, so we begin by opening the 
      namespace of the              <CODE>List</CODE> module:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; open List;;</PRE>
      <P>Testing to see if one queen can attack another is a core operation in 
      this program that can be implemented using simple arithmetic:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let safe (x1, y1) (x2, y2) =
    x1 &lt;&gt; x2 &amp;&amp; y1 &lt;&gt; y2 &amp;&amp; x2-x1 &lt;&gt; y2-y1 &amp;&amp; x1-y2 &lt;&gt; x2-y1;;
val safe : int * int -&gt; int * int -&gt; bool</PRE>
      <P>The program revolves around a              <CODE>search</CODE> function 
      that considers both placing and not-placing a queen at each position in    
                <CODE>ps</CODE> , storing the current list of queens in          
          <CODE>qs</CODE> and applying              <CODE>f</CODE> to every full 
      set of              <CODE>qs</CODE> :           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let rec search f n qs ps =
    match ps with
    | [] -&gt; if length qs = n then f qs
    | q::ps -&gt;
        search f n qs ps;
        search f n (q::qs) (filter (safe q) ps);;
val search :
  ((int * int) list -&gt; unit) -&gt;
  int -&gt; (int * int) list -&gt; (int * int) list -&gt; unit</PRE>
      <P>The first pattern is matched when all positions are exhausted. If       
             <I>n</I> queens were found then the function              
      <CODE>f</CODE> is applied to              <CODE>qs</CODE> .           </P>
      <P>The second pattern is matched when a queen is considered at             
       <CODE>q</CODE> with              <CODE>ps</CODE> positions remaining. The 
      search is split two ways, firstly trying without a queen and then trying 
      with a queen at              <CODE>q</CODE> . In the latter case, the 
      remaining positions              <CODE>ps</CODE> has all unsafe positions 
      filtered out before continuing the search.           </P>
      <P>The square board of positions may be generated with a list 
      comprehension:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let ps n =
    [ for i in 1 .. n
        for j in 1 .. n -&gt;
          i, j ];;
val ps : int -&gt; (int * int) list</PRE>
      <P>A board with queens at              <CODE>qs</CODE> may be printed 
      with:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let print n qs =
    for y in 1 .. n do
      for x in 1 .. n do
        printf "%s" (if mem (x, y) qs then "Q" else ".")
      printf "\n"
    printf "\n";;
val print : (int * int) list -&gt; unit</PRE>
      <P>The solutions for a given board size              <CODE>n</CODE> can be 
      found and printed with:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let solve n = search (print n) n [] (ps n);;
val solve : int -&gt; unit</PRE>
      <P>The following prints the 92 solutions for              <I>n=8</I> :     
            </P>
<PRE>&gt; solve 8;;</PRE>
      <P>The remarkable brevity of this program demonstrates the utility of 
      functional programming. The main data structure is an immutable list. 
      Searching is performed using a recursive function. Several functions 
      exploit currying and higher-order functions in the interests of 
      brevity.</P>
      <P>The              <CODE>search</CODE> function makes use of combinators, 
      using them to search recursively whilst filtering out valid solutions. 
      Returning from the first search to start another search is known as        
            <I>backtracking</I> and is made particularly elegant by immutability 
      as there is no need to undo state changes.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>print</CODE> function also make considerable use 
      of functional programming, using the higher-order              
      <CODE>List.iter</CODE> function.           </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
