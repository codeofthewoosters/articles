      <H1>Traversing networks: the nth-nearest neighbor</H1>
      <P>Graph theory has a great many practical applications ranging from 
      compiler internals to the study of the structural characteristics of 
      materials. This article describes the design and implementation of a 
      program that finds the              <I>n</I>             <SUP>th</SUP>
       -nearest neighbors of a given vertex in an infinite graph. This problem 
      is of interest in the context of atomic structures.           </P>
      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P>The program developed in this article covers the following topics:</P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Set-theoretic operations: union, intersection and difference.</LI>
        <LI>Graph-theoretic operations:                  <I>n</I>                
         <SUP>th</SUP> -nearest neighbors.               </LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>The graph-theoretic problem of finding the              <I>n</I>        
           <SUP>th</SUP> -nearest neighbours allows useful topological 
      information to be gathered from many forms of data produced by other 
      programs. For example, in the case of simulated atomic structures, where 
      topological information can aid the interpretation of experimental results 
      when trying to understand molecular structure. Such topological 
      information can also be used indirectly, in the computation of interesting 
      properties such as the decomposition of correlation functions over 
      neighbour shells and shortest-path ring statistics.           </P>
      <P>We shall describe our unconventional formulation of the problem of 
      computing the              <I>n</I>             <SUP>th</SUP> -nearest 
      neighbours of atoms in an atomic structure simulated under periodic 
      boundary conditions before describing a program for solving this problem 
      and presenting demonstrative results.           </P>
      <H2>Formulation</H2>
      <P>The notion of the              <I>n</I>             <SUP>th</SUP>
       -nearest neighbours              <I>N(i,n)</I> of a vertex              
      <I>i</I> in a graph is rigorously defined by a recurrence relation based 
      upon the set of first nearest neighbours  of any atom:           </P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Traversing%20networks%20the%20nth-nearest%20neighbor_files/nth.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>The base case              <I>{i}</I> for              <I>n=0</I> 
      conveys that the 0             <SUP>th</SUP> -nearest neighbors of a 
      vertex is simply the set containing only that vertex. The base case        
            <I>T               <SUB>i</SUB>             </I> for              
      <I>n=1</I> is the set of nearest neighbors of the vertex              
      <I>i</I> and is a fundamental property of the network.           </P>
      <P>As a recurrence relation, this computational task naturally lends 
      itself to recursion. As this recurrence relation only makes use of the 
      set-theoretic operations union and difference, the data structure 
      manipulated by the recursive function is most naturally a              
      <CODE>Set</CODE> (described in section).           </P>
      <P>In order to develop a useful scientific program, we shall use an 
      infinite graph to represent the topology of a crystal, i.e. a periodic 
      tiling. Computer simulations of non-crystalline materials are typically 
      formulated as a crystal with the largest possible unit cell, known as the 
      supercell. Conventional approaches to the analysis of these structures 
      reference atoms by their index  within the origin supercell. Edges in the 
      graph representing bonded pairs of atoms in different cells are then 
      handled by treating displacements modulo the supercell:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Traversing%20networks%20the%20nth-nearest%20neighbor_files/conventional.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>However, this conventional approach is well-known to be flawed when 
      applied to insufficiently large supercells, requiring erroneous results to 
      be identified and weeded out manually.</P>
      <P>Instead, we shall choose to reference atoms by an index composed not 
      only of the vertex within the supercell but also the offset of the 
      supercell from the origin:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Traversing%20networks%20the%20nth-nearest%20neighbor_files/unconventional.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>Neighbouring vertices in the graph representing the topology are 
      defined not only by the index of the neighbouring vertex but also by the 
      supercell containing this neighbour (assuming the origin vertex to be in 
      the origin supercell at).</P>
      <H2>Implementation</H2>
      <P>We shall now develop a complete program for computing the nearest 
      neighbours of a given vertex with index  from a list of lists  of the 
      indices of the neighbours of each vertex. We begin by referencing the F# 
      Power Pack and defining the types that will represent our network of 
      bonded atoms:</P>

<PRE>&gt; type t = { supercell: vector; vertices: vertex array };;
type t =
  {supercell: vector;
   vertices: vertex array;}</PRE>
      <H3>Lexer</H3>
      <P>In this case, we shall hand roll our own lexer as a simple F# sequence 
      expression:</P>
<PRE>&gt; type token = Open | Close | Number of float;;
type token =

  | Number of float</PRE>
<PRE>&gt; let rec lex (s: string) =

            | '{' -&gt; yield Open
            | '}' -&gt; yield Close
            | ' ' | '\t' | '\n' | '\r' | ',' -&gt; ()
            | _ -&gt;
                let j = ref !i
                while s.[!j + 1] &lt;&gt; ',' &amp;&amp; s.[!j + 1] &lt;&gt; '}' do
                  incr j
                yield Number(float(s.Substring(!i, !j - !i + 1)))
                i := !j
            incr i };;
val lex : string -&gt; seq&lt;token&gt;</PRE>
      <P>This may be used to generate a sequence of tokens from a file as 
      follows:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let file = __SOURCE_DIRECTORY__ + @"\cfg-100k-aSi.txt";;

      <H2>Parser</H2>
      <P>The grammar is a sufficiently simple subset of Mathematica syntax that 
      the parser can also be a hand-rolled function that converts a              
      <CODE>token list</CODE> into a              <CODE>float tree</CODE> :

           <CODE>float tree</CODE> form, we shall convert it into the more 
      strongly-typed              <CODE>system</CODE> type that will be more 
      efficient in the upcoming traversals:           </P>
