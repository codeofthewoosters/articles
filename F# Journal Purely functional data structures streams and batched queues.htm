      <H1>Purely functional data structures: streams and batched queues</H1>
      <P>This article is the first in a series describing the design and 
      implementation of some very useful purely functional data structures. Lazy 
      evaluation, lazy streams and batched queues are described in detail. In 
      particular, new .NET interfaces, classes and objects are used factor the 
      implementations of the data structure and various built-in interfaces are 
      implemented in order to support equality, comparison and hashing of these 
      new data structures.</P>
      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P><I>Purely functional data structures</I> is the term used to describe 
      data structures that use a variety of ingenious techniques to provide 
      efficiency without mutation. The immutability of these data structures 
      makes it much easier to reason about programs that use them. However,  
      this ease-of-use is typically offset by substantial performance 
      degradation compared to traditional imperative data structures.           
      </P>
      <P>At the time of writing, the best resource about purely functional data 
      structures by far is Chris Okasaki's book              <A href="http://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504">Purely 
      Functional Data Structures</A> . This book presents source code written in 
      SML with an appendix containing implementations written in Haskell. 
      However, those implementations make extensive use of language features 
      that F# does not have and, consequently, the reimplementation of those 
      data structures in F# is a considerable undertaking. This series of 
      articles will elucidate the techniques required to translate idiomatic 
      functional data structures from other languages into F# using .NET's 
      object system.           </P>
      <P>The most important lesson taught by the book Purely Functional Data 
      Structures is that amortization is the key to efficiency. In other words, 
      deferring computations and performing them in batches is essential if the 
      performance characteristics of imperative data structures are to be 
      regained. Moreover, lazy evaluation allows computations to be amortized 
      efficiently without undermining beneficial properties of purely functional 
      data structures such as persistence.</P>
      <H2>Lazy values</H2>
      <P>Lazy              <I>thunks</I> are created using the              
      <CODE>lazy</CODE> keyword as follows:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; lazy(1+2*3);;
val it : Lazy&lt;int&gt;
= Microsoft.FSharp.Control.Lazy`1[System.Int32] {IsDelayed = true;
                                                 IsException = false;
                                                 IsForced = false;
                                                 Value = 7;}</PRE>
      <P>A thunk is initially a computation that has been deferred, i.e. an 
      unevaluated expression.</P>
      <P>The              <CODE>Value</CODE> member is used to force the 
      evaluation of a lazy value:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; let n = lazy(1+2*3);;
val n : Lazy&lt;int&gt;</PRE>
<PRE>&gt; n.Value;;
val it : int = 7</PRE>
      <P>Note that the F# standard library automatically enforces mutual 
      exclusion so that purely functional code is thread safe when forcing the 
      same lazy value from separate threads simultaneously.</P>
      <P>This also has the effect of replacing the expression with the value 
      that it evaluated to, i.e. thunks use mutation internally. This effect is 
      easily seen in F# by putting impure code in the thunk:</P>
<PRE>&gt; let t = lazy(printfn "Evaluated");;
val t : Lazy&lt;unit&gt;</PRE>
<PRE>&gt; t.Value;;
Evaluated
val it : unit = ()</PRE>
<PRE>&gt; t.Value;;
val it : unit = ()</PRE>
<PRE>&gt; t.Value;;
val it : unit = ()</PRE>
      <P>Note that the expression in the thunk was only evaluated once.</P>
      <H2>Lazy streams</H2>
      <P>The following              <CODE>Stream</CODE> type defines a generic 
      lazy stream implementation:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; type Stream&lt;'a&gt; = Nil | Cons of 'a * 'a Stream Lazy with
    member private s.getEnumerator =
      let decap = function
        | Nil -&gt; None
        | Cons(h, t) -&gt; Some(h, t.Value)
      (Seq.unfold decap s).GetEnumerator()
    
    interface IEnumerable&lt;'a&gt; with
      member s.GetEnumerator() = s.getEnumerator
    
    interface IEnumerable with
      member s.GetEnumerator() = (s.getEnumerator :&gt; IEnumerator)</PRE>
<PRE>    interface System.IEquatable&lt;Stream&lt;'a&gt;&gt; with
      member stream1.Equals(stream2: Stream&lt;'a&gt;) =
        List.of_seq stream1 = List.of_seq stream2</PRE>
<PRE>    override stream1.Equals stream2 =
      List.of_seq stream1 = List.of_seq (unbox stream2)</PRE>
<PRE>    interface System.IComparable&lt;Stream&lt;'a&gt;&gt; with
      member stream1.CompareTo(stream2: Stream&lt;'a&gt;) =
        Seq.compare compare stream1 stream2</PRE>
<PRE>    interface System.IComparable with
      member stream1.CompareTo(stream2: obj) =
        Seq.compare compare stream1 (unbox stream2)
    
    interface IComparer&lt;Stream&lt;'a&gt;&gt; with
      member stream.Compare(stream1, stream2) =
        Seq.compare compare stream1 stream2
    
    override stream.GetHashCode() =
      (List.of_seq stream).GetHashCode()</PRE>
<PRE>    interface IStructuralHash with
      member stream.GetStructuralHashCode n =
        hash(List.of_seq stream);;
type Stream&lt;'a&gt; =
  | Nil
  | Cons of 'a * Lazy&lt;Stream&lt;'a&gt;&gt;
  with
    interface IStructuralHash
    interface IComparer&lt;Stream&lt;'a&gt;&gt;
    interface System.IComparable

    interface System.IEquatable&lt;Stream&lt;'a&gt;&gt;
    interface IEnumerable
    interface IEnumerable&lt;'a&gt;
    override Equals : stream2:obj -&gt; bool
    override GetHashCode : unit -&gt; int
    member private getEnumerator : IEnumerator&lt;'a&gt;
  end</PRE>
      <P>There are some notable points about this implementation:</P>
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Rather than make every lazy stream a thunk, we shift the laziness 
        into the tail of the                  <CODE>Cons</CODE> constructor. 
        This makes it more efficient to handle empty lazy streams and improves 
        performance for the subsequent data structures.               </LI>
        <LI>The data structure used to represent the stream is an F# variant 
        type with augmentations implementing various .NET and F# interfaces and 
        overriding the                  <CODE>Equals</CODE> and                  
        <CODE>GetHashCode</CODE> members of the                  
        <CODE>Object</CODE> class.               </LI>
        <LI>The                  <CODE>Stream.t</CODE> type is public because 
        this allows lazy streams to be deconstructed using pattern matching 
        outside the                  <CODE>Stream</CODE> module.               
        </LI></UL>
      <P></P>
      <P>The interfaces implemented by the              <CODE>Stream.t</CODE> 
      type are of particular importance.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>IStructuralHash</CODE> interface is defined by 
      F# and used by its              <CODE>Hashtable</CODE> and              
      <CODE>HashSet</CODE> implementations. If this interface is not implemented 
      then hashing uses the .NET              <CODE>GetHashCode</CODE> member 
      from the              <CODE>Object</CODE> class that is not structural, 
      i.e. lazy streams with the same elements can produce different results 
      with              <CODE>GetHashCode</CODE> and that would produce 
      unexpected results if a user tried to use a              
      <CODE>HashSet</CODE> of our lazy streams or a              
      <CODE>Hashtable</CODE> with our lazy streams as keys.           </P>
      <P>The non-generic              <CODE>IComparable</CODE> interface is 
      defined by .NET and used by ordered data structures such as the            
        <CODE>Set</CODE> data structure in F#. If this interface is not 
      implemented then code that relies upon structural untyped comparison will 
      fail, e.g. a user building a              <CODE>Set</CODE> of our lazy 
      streams would see unexpected results.           </P>
      <P>The generic              <CODE>IComparable&lt;_&gt;</CODE> interface is 
      defined by .NET and is used by the F#              <CODE>compare</CODE> 
      function.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>Equals</CODE> member inherited from the base     
               <CODE>Object</CODE> class is used by the              
      <CODE>=</CODE> operator in F#.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>IEquatable&lt;_&gt;.Equals</CODE> interface 
      member is used by              <CODE>HashSet</CODE> .           </P>
      <P>Note that the generic              <CODE>IComparer&lt;_&gt;</CODE> ,    
                <CODE>IComparable&lt;_&gt;</CODE> and              
      <CODE>IEquatable&lt;_&gt;</CODE> interfaces are all parameterized over the 
                   <CODE>Stream&lt;'a&gt;</CODE> class and not over the element 
      type              <CODE>'a</CODE> .           </P>
      <P>We may now implement any ML-style functions over the              
      <CODE>Stream</CODE> type by creating a module with the same name:          
       </P>
<PRE>&gt; module Stream =
    let empty = Nil
    
    let rec range i j =
      if i=j then Cons(i, lazy empty) else
        Cons(i, lazy(range (i+1) j));;
module Stream = begin
  val empty : Stream&lt;'a&gt;
  val range : int -&gt; int -&gt; Stream&lt;int&gt;
end</PRE>
      <P>This lazy stream implementation will be used extensively by the data 
      structure implementations in the remainder of this article.</P>
      <H2>Queues</H2>
      <P>We shall present two different purely functional queue implementations 
      as classes that adhere to the following              <CODE>IQueue</CODE> 
      interface:           </P>
<PRE>&gt; type IQueue&lt;'a&gt; =
    inherit IEnumerable&lt;'a&gt;
    inherit IEnumerable
    inherit System.IEquatable&lt;IQueue&lt;'a&gt;&gt;
    inherit System.IComparable&lt;IQueue&lt;'a&gt;&gt;
    inherit IComparer&lt;IQueue&lt;'a&gt;&gt;
    inherit IStructuralHash
    abstract IsEmpty : bool
    abstract PushBack : 'a -&gt; IQueue&lt;'a&gt;
    abstract PopFront : unit -&gt; 'a * IQueue&lt;'a&gt;;;
type IQueue&lt;'a&gt; =
  interface
    inherit IStructuralHash
    inherit IComparer&lt;IQueue&lt;'a&gt;&gt;
    inherit System.IComparable&lt;IQueue&lt;'a&gt;&gt;
    inherit System.IEquatable&lt;IQueue&lt;'a&gt;&gt;
    inherit IEnumerable
    inherit IEnumerable&lt;'a&gt;
    abstract member PopFront : unit -&gt; 'a * IQueue&lt;'a&gt;
    abstract member PushBack : 'a -&gt; IQueue&lt;'a&gt;
    abstract member IsEmpty : bool
  end</PRE>
      <P>This is our first major diversion from the techniques used in the 
      solutions presented by Okasaki. Specifically, Okasaki made heavy use of a 
      feature of the ML family of languages known as higher-order modules. That 
      feature essentially allows classes to be parameterized over other classes 
      and, in particular, this is resolved entirely at compile time and, 
      consequently, is completely statically type checkes and does not incur any 
      run-time performance penalties. F# does not have this language feature so 
      we must find a workaround.</P>
      <P>The most obvious alternative is to replace the compile-time constructs 
      from Okasaki's original work with run-time constructs in F#, namely 
      objects. Thus we create a new type, the abstract interface              
      <CODE>IQueue</CODE> that refers to itself. For example, pushing an element 
      onto the back of the queue using the              <CODE>PushBack</CODE> 
      member now returns a value of the abstract              
      <CODE>IQueue</CODE> type rather than the concrete type as Okasaki's code 
      did. This provides the same amount of code reuse that Okasaki benefitted 
      from but incurs substantial performance overheads as all static functions 
      have been replaced with members that must use virtual dispatch to the 
      appropriate concrete implementation.           </P>
      <H3>Batched queues</H3>
      <P>The simplest queue implementation is known as a              <I>batched 
      queue</I> because it batches computations in order to provide good 
      amortized asymptotic O(1) complexity for its core operations. This data 
      structure may be implemented using front and back lists where the back 
      list is stored in reverse:           </P>

      <P></P>
      <P>The front list is always kept non-empty if possible. Taking elements 
      from the queue typically decapitates the head element of the front list 
      but, if that empties the front list, the back list is reversed and used to 
      replace the front list. Consequently, taking an element from the queue is 
      typically O(1) but can be O(n).</P>
      <P>Moreover, persistence is an important characteristic of purely 
      functional data structures. For example, the same queue may have its front 
      element taken many times. With this queue implementation, the expensive 
      list reversal will be performed repeatedly because the result was not 
      remembered from one use of persistence to the next.</P>
      <P>These performance issues can be addressed by the use of a more 
      sophisticated              <I>real-time</I> queue.           </P>
      <H2>Summary</H2>
      <P>This article has described the concept of purely functional data 
      structures and the importance of lazy evaluation in that context before 
      giving concrete implementations of two purely functional data structures, 
      streams and queues, and an interface that can be used to handle queues 
      abstractly.</P>
      <P>The next article in this series will describe the design and 
      implementation of a real-time queue that provides worst case              
      <I>O(1)</I> complexity for all operations even when used persistently and 
      from multiple threads. Performance measurements will be used to 
      demonstrate the improved characteristics of the real time queue over the 
      batched queue described in this article.
