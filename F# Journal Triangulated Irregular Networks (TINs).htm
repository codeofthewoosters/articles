      <P>Adaptive subdivision is a hot topic in computer graphics and forms the 
      foundation of many state-of-the-art algorithms for large scale 
      visualization used for everything from scientific visualization of huge 
      data sets to game graphics that immerse players in expansive virtual 
      worlds. This article describes one of the most popular approaches for the 
      adaptive subdivision of 3D meshes and implements a capable plotting 
      algorithm with real-time visualization using Windows Presentation 
      Foundation showcasing how this simple algorithm works and can be used to 
      solve many different problems.</P>
      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P>Although some problems can be solved using flat array-based data 
      structures and loop-based algorithms, the ability to handle a variety of 
      scales inevitably requires to use of hierarchical tree-like data 
      structures and, consequently, recursive algorithms. Such applications are 
      in abundance in the context of computer graphics, where modern 
      visualization frameworks are required to render a wide range of scales, 
      from individual organisms to entire planets.</P>
      <P>Adaptive subdivision algorithms are beautiful examples of recursion 
      being applied very successfully to fundamental problems. The following 
      diagram illustrates how a single two-triangle square may be recursively 
      decomposed into progressively more triangles, giving a finer-grained 
      tesselations, in order to focus triangle density on a certain area:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Triangulated%20Irregular%20Networks%20(TINs)_files/rtin.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>In its simplest form, such an algorithm has two different aspects:</P>
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI>A function to split a given triangle in a mesh.</LI>
        <LI>A metric quantifying the desire to split any given triangle.</LI></OL>
      <P></P>
      <P>This is precisely the approach described and implemented in this 
      article. The representation is sometimes known as a Right-angle Triangular 
      Irregular Network (RTIN) because it is assumed to start with right-angled 
      triangles and subdivides them along their hypotenuses to produce more 
      right-angled triangles. However, the algorithm is actually completely 
      agnostic with regard to the vertex positions so any layout can be used 
      with the same simple algorithm.</P>
      <P>The RTIN was made famous in the context of terrain rendering by the 
      Real-time Optimally-Adapting Mesh (ROAM) algorithm described              
      <A href="https://graphics.llnl.gov/ROAM/roam.pdf">here</A> . Although this 
      technique has been superceded in the context of terrain rendering by newer 
      algorithms than handle batches of triangles in order to push computational 
      burden onto the previously-underused GPU, this basic approach is still the 
      method of choice for a variety of other applications including graph 
      plotting.           </P>
      <H2>Design</H2>
      <P>Let us begin by considering the theoretical task of representing and 
      subdividing such a mesh.</P>
      <H3>Representing triangles</H3>
      <P>A triangle in a mesh may be represented by its three vertices and its 
      three neighboring triangles. In the context of a right-angle triangular 
      network, a triangle also has a apex vertex and a hypotenuse edge.</P>
      <H3>Representing a mesh of connected triangles</H3>
      <P>An entire connected mesh may be traversed by following each triangle's 
      links to its neighbors. Consequently, we might represent a mesh by a 
      single "root" triangle. However, we wish to be able to split some 
      triangles more than others according to our metric so we shall represent 
      the mesh by the set of all of the triangles that it contains. The built-in 
                   <CODE>Set</CODE>  module provides an elegant way to store a 
      set of triangles that is particularly suitable because we can order the 
      triangles in a set according to their error metric. This technique is 
      referred to as a priority queue for splitting in the ROAM paper.           
      </P>
      <H3>Subdividing triangles</H3>
      <P>The process of splitting is quite simple for this kind of TIN:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Triangulated%20Irregular%20Networks%20(TINs)_files/split.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>A triangle may be split only when it is hypotenuse to hypotenuse with 
      its neighbor. If this is not the case then the neighbor sharing the 
      hypotenuse must be split in order to make this the case.</P>
      <P>The split then replaces the two neighboring triangles with four 
      triangles by introducing a new central vertex. Note that this affects not 
      only the two removed and four inserted triangles but also their four 
      neighbors, which must have their neighbor information updated to keep the 
      topology consistent.</P>
      <P>Although it is entirely feasible to perform the reverse              
      <I>merge</I> operation we shall not consider it here.           </P>
      <H3>The error metric</H3>
      <P>Having mastered the subdivision process itself, it is essential that 
      the effort of subdivision is focused on the appropriate parts of the mesh. 
      This is done by choosing a suitable error metric and subdividing the 
      triangles that are the poorest approximation to the underlying surface 
      first.</P>
      <P>In the context of tesselating surface plots, the distance of a function 
      evaluation from the centre of the triangle to the surface of the triangle 
      gives an estimate of how accurately the flat triangle represents the 
      underlying surface:</P>
      <P>

      <P>Generic comparison is overridden using the              
      <CODE>CompareTo</CODE> member of the              
      <CODE>System.IComparable</CODE> interface. This compared by error metric 
      first and then vertices, ensuring that a set of triangles is sorted 
      primarily by error but also allowing many triangles to share the same 
      error metric by having different vertices (otherwise the

      <P>Generic equality is overridden using the              
      <CODE>Equals</CODE> member found in any object and simply uses physical

      <P>Note that the error metric is a function of immutable data in the 
      triangle (the vertex positions) and not mutable data. Thus, we may mutate 
      the neighbor topology of a triangle safe in the knowledge that we have not

      <P>Considering how short this program is, the fidelity and functionality

      <H2>Summary</H2>
      <P>This article has described and implemented the simplest form of 
      adaptive subdivision and has already provided the beginnings of a 
      sophisticated adaptive 3D surface plotter capable of handling irregular 
      surfaces and even branch cuts.</P>
      <P>This program can be used as the foundation of many other applications 
      including terrain visualization, planet visualization and contour 
      plotting. The rendering of 2D contours using this technology is 
      particularly enlightening: the error metric is chosen to split triangles 
      that span the boundary of one or more contours.</P>
      <P>Future F#.NET Journal articles will revisit the subject of adaptive 
      subdivision.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
