      <H1>Beginner's XNA tutorial</H1>
      <P>Microsoft's XNA framework is a .NET library intended primarily for 
      games programming that superceded Managed Direct X (MDX). XNA provides a 
      safer, higher-level design that still exposes low-level graphics 
      capabilities in order to provide the best possible performance for 
      graphics-intensive software from a managed language. This article 
      describes everything required to get rendering using the XNA framework 
      with F#, from the most primitive built in effects to custom shader 
      programs.</P>
      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P>Microsoft's              <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=7D70D6ED-1EDD-4852-9883-9A33C0AD8FEE&amp;displaylang=en">XNA 
      Game Studio</A> is described as "a toolset that makes creating great video 
      games for Windows-based PCs, the Zune digital media player, and the Xbox 
      360 console (with an active premium XNA Creators Club subscription) easier 
      than ever". Installing this development environment installs the managed 
      DLLs required to use XNA from F#.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>Microsoft.Xna.Framework</CODE> and              
      <CODE>Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game</CODE> DLLs are located in the          
          <CODE>C:\Program Files\Microsoft XNA\XNA Game 
      Studio\v3.0\References\Windows\x86</CODE> directory by default and must be 
      added as references to an F# project using XNA:           </P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Beginner's%20XNA%20tutorial_files/references.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>Standalone XNA-based executables may now be built using F#. This 
      article describes how the XNA framework may be used to build Windows 
      applications entirely from within F#.</P>
      <H2>Minimal 2D example</H2>
      <P>We begin by creating the simplest possible XNA program that displays 
      graphics.</P>
      <P>XNA-related definitions come from the following namespace:</P>
<PRE>open Microsoft.Xna.Framework</PRE>
      <P>The              <CODE>Graphics</CODE> namespace therein is also 
      heavily used and may also be opened in a real project but we shall name 
      its members explicitly in this program to aid clarity.           </P>
      <P>The XNA framework provides a single core class type called              
      <CODE>Game</CODE> that encapsulates the entire application. Compared to 
      rich user interface libraries like Windows Presentation Foundation, the    
                <CODE>Game</CODE> class is remarkably simple.           </P>
      <P>We use the classic object oriented approach of creating our own         
           <CODE>XnaTest</CODE> class that is derived from the              
      <CODE>Game</CODE> class and overrides some members in order to achieve the 
      desired functionality:           </P>
<PRE>type XnaTest() as this =
  inherit Game()</PRE>
      <P>The definition of our class begins with some              
      <CODE>let</CODE> bindings to define private data.           </P>
      <P>The              <CODE>GraphicsDeviceManager</CODE> class encapsulates 
      both a Direct X device and much of the code required to maintain its state 
      after device resets and losses:           </P>
<PRE>  let mutable graphics : GraphicsDeviceManager = null</PRE>
      <P>The              <CODE>Effect</CODE> base class encapsulates the 
      techniques that may be used to interpret vertex data when rendering:       
          </P>
<PRE>  let mutable effect : Graphics.Effect = null</PRE>
      <P>The              <CODE>VertexDeclaration</CODE> property of the 
      graphics device must be set in order to describe the contents of the 
      vertex type:           </P>
<PRE>  let mutable vertexDeclaration : Graphics.VertexDeclaration = null</PRE>
      <P>In this example, we shall draw a set of white points at random 
      locations:</P>
<PRE>  let rand = System.Random()
  let n_verts = 100000
  let random_vert _ =
    Graphics.VertexPositionColor(Vector3(0.f, 0.f, 0.f), Graphics.Color.White)
  let vertex = Array.init n_verts random_vert</PRE>
      <P>Although we are using a vertex type              
      <CODE>VertexPositionColor</CODE> that includes per-vertex colors and we 
      have set them all to white, this information is actually ignored by the 
      basic effect provided by XNA that we shall use. Drawing colored points 
      requires the use of (simple) custom shaders to create a suitable technique 
      in the effect.           </P>
      <P>The implicit constructor for our class simply creates a              
      <CODE>GraphicsDeviceManager</CODE> :           </P>
<PRE>  do
    graphics &lt;- new GraphicsDeviceManager(this)</PRE>
      <P>Our              <CODE>graphics</CODE> variable could have been set 
      when it was defined but its creation requires a reference to              
      <CODE>this</CODE> and, consequently, requires run-time checks for 
      consistency. The F# compiler requests that all such actions are placed in 
      a single              <CODE>do</CODE> block as we have done here.          
       </P>
      <P>We override the              <CODE>Initialize</CODE> method from the    
                <CODE>Game</CODE> to set the variables to their initial values:  
               </P>
<PRE>  override this.Initialize() =
    base.Initialize()
    this.IsMouseVisible &lt;- true
    let gd = graphics.GraphicsDevice
    effect &lt;- new Graphics.BasicEffect(gd, null)
    let elts = Graphics.VertexPositionColor.VertexElements
    vertexDeclaration &lt;- new Graphics.VertexDeclaration(gd, elts)</PRE>
      <P>Note that we use the built-in              <CODE>BasicEffect</CODE> 
      class for our              <CODE>effect</CODE> variable. This is the 
      easiest way to get started with XNA but the real power lies in custom 
      shaders, as we shall see in the next section.           </P>
      <P>We override the              <CODE>Draw</CODE> method from the          
          <CODE>Game</CODE> in order to draw the required graphical elements:    
             </P>
<PRE>  override this.Draw gameTime =
    let gd = graphics.GraphicsDevice
    gd.VertexDeclaration &lt;- vertexDeclaration
    gd.Clear Graphics.Color.Black
    for i=0 to n_verts - 1 do
      let x() = 2. * rand.NextDouble() - 1. |&gt; float32
      vertex.[i].Position &lt;- Vector3(x(), x(), x())
    effect.Begin()
    for pass in effect.CurrentTechnique.Passes do
      pass.Begin()
      let prim = PrimitiveType.PointList
      gd.DrawUserPrimitives(prim, vertex, 0, n_verts)
      pass.End()
    effect.End()</PRE>
      <P>In this case, we simply clear the device to black, randomize the 
      coordinates of the vertices and draw the vertices as points using the 
      default effect. Note how we loop over the effect's passes. In this case, 
      there is a single pass but more sophisticated forms of rendering can use 
      multiple passes to add special effects such as blurs around light 
      sources.</P>
      <P>Finally, the main part of the program constructs an object of our       
             <CODE>XnaTest</CODE> class and calls its              
      <CODE>Run</CODE> method to run the "game".           </P>
<PRE>do
  use game = new XnaTest()
  game.Run()</PRE>
      <P>The whole program is well under 50 lines of code and produces the 
      following result using hardware acceleration where possible:</P>
      <P>
      <P style="text-align: center;"><IMG src="F%23%20Journal%20Beginner's%20XNA%20tutorial_files/test.gif"> 
                  </P>
      <P></P>
      <P>A Visual Studio 2008 project containing the full source code is 
      available for download              <A href="http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/fsharp_journal/subscribers/code/40/XNATest.zip">here</A>
       .           </P>
      <H2>3D graphics with custom shaders</H2>
      <P>The minimal example presented in the last section used the              
      <CODE>BasicEffect</CODE> class built into XNA. This provides only the most 
      rudimentary vertex and pixel shaders. These shaders will run on almost all 
      graphics hardware and, consequently, are the default for ubiquitous 
      graphics like Windows Presentation Foundation.           </P>
      <P>However, the XNA framework allows us to write our own shaders in the 
      High-Level Shader Language (HLSL). This empowers us with the ability to 
      control exactly how the graphics hardware interprets and handles vertex 
      data both per-vertex and even per-pixel. The              <I>programmable 
      graphics pipeline</I> is the most revolutionary innovation that consumer 
      graphics has seen in decades and there is no excuse for missing out on 
      these awesome capabilities!           </P>
      <P>In this example we shall open both namespaces:</P>
<PRE>open Microsoft.Xna.Framework
open Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics</PRE>
      <P>The following              <CODE>Icosahedron</CODE> module creates 
      vertex and index arrays for an approximation to the icosahedron:           
      </P>
<PRE>module Icosahedron =
  let vertex =
    let vec3 x y z = x, y, z
    let r = sin(System.Math.PI / 3.)
    let s = 1. / sqrt 5.
    let f g x = r * g(float x * System.Math.PI / 5.)
    let aux n y i = vec3 (f sin (2 * i + n)) y (f cos (2 * i + n))
    [|yield vec3 0. 1. 0.
      for i in 0 .. 4 do yield aux 0 s i
      for i in 0 .. 4 do yield aux 1 (-s) i
      yield vec3 0. -1. 0.|]</PRE>
<PRE>  let index =
    let r1 i = 1 + (1 + i) % 5
    let r2 i = 6 + (1 + i) % 5
    [|for i in 0 .. 4 do yield 0, r1 i, r1(i + 1)
      for i in 0 .. 4 do yield r1(i + 1), r1 i, r2 i
      for i in 0 .. 4 do yield r1(i + 1), r2 i, r2(i + 1)
      for i in 0 .. 4 do yield r2(i+1), r2 i, 11|]</PRE>
      <P>This is derived from the code in our book              <A href="http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/fsharp_for_scientists/">F# 
      for Scientists</A> but updated for the September 2008 F# CTP using the new 
                   <CODE>yield</CODE> notation for sequence expressions.         
        </P>
      <P>As a demonstration of XNA's capabilities we shall define and use our 
      own custom              <CODE>vertex</CODE> struct type           </P>
<PRE>type Vertex = struct
  val Position : Vector3
  val Normal : Vector3
  val Color : Color
  new(p, n, c) = { Position = p; Normal = n; Color = c }
  
  static member VertexElements =
    let ve3 = VertexElementFormat.Vector3
    let vec = VertexElementFormat.Color
    let m = VertexElementMethod.Default
    let o n = sizeof&lt;float32&gt; * n |&gt; int16
    [|
      VertexElement(0s, o 0, ve3, m, VertexElementUsage.Position, 0uy);
      VertexElement(0s, o 3, ve3, m, VertexElementUsage.Normal, 0uy);
      VertexElement(0s, o 6, vec, m, VertexElementUsage.Color, 0uy);
    |]
end</PRE>
      <P>The              <CODE>VertexElements</CODE> property is an array that 
      declares the internal representation of a vertex. In particular, the 
      nested              <CODE>o</CODE> function is used to compute the offset 
      in bytes of each field from the start of the struct.           </P>
      <P>The following              <CODE>subdivide</CODE> function refines a 
      triangular mesh approximating a sphere but subdividing each triangle into 
      four smaller triangles:           </P>

      <P>The constructor builds a

      <P>A Visual Studio 2008 project containing the full source code is

      <P>This result illustrates two different lighting models that are both 
      commonly seen in computer graphics. The sphere on the left was rendered 
      using "Gouraud" shading, a technique where a color is determined for each 
      vertex and the color across a triangle is a linear interpolation between 
      the colors of its vertices. The sphere on the right uses "Phong" shading 
      where surface normals are interpolated across each triangle and the same 
      lighting expression is used to calculate the color of each pixel.</P>
      <P>Although Phong shading produces substantially higher fidelity images, 
      it is a lot more computationally expensive because it requires 
      interpolated normals to be normalized to unit length and the lighting 
      calculations to be performed for each of hundreds of thousands of  pixels 
      rather than only a few dozen vertices. Consequently, Gouraud shading is 
      the method of choice and is the only option available from many libraries 
      such as Windows Presentation Foundation. However, modern graphics hardware 
      is easily capable of this feat so Phong shading, also known as             
       <I>per-pixel lighting</I> , is ubiquitous in today's computer games.

      <H2>Summary</H2>
      <P>This article has described the basic design and use of XNA including 
      the ability to specify custom vertex and pixel shader for the ultimate 
      fine-grained control over the rendering pipeline.</P>
      <P>The XNA framework is specifically designed for games programming and 
      makes it relatively easy to produce stand-alone programs with advanced 
      graphical capabilities that run on a wide variety of machines. However, 
      many other applications can benefit from such advanced graphical 
      capabilities so XNA should not be dismissed as a technology that is only 
      of interest to games programmers.</P>
      <P>XNA can also be used to target the XBox platform, which will be the 
      subject of a future F#.NET Journal article.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
